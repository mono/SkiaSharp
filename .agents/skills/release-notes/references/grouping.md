# Grouping & categorizing the changes

Release notes are **curated**, not exhaustive. The single biggest quality failure is rendering
**one bullet per PR** — a wall of 50+ line items. A good page merges related PRs into a handful
of **thematic bullets**, each telling one product story. This file is how.

## The density budget

Across **all** category sections combined, aim for **5–12 product bullets total** — not one per
PR. A single bullet carries **2–8 related PRs**. Reserve a solo bullet only for a genuine
standalone landmark (the engine bump, one headline API, a breaking-only change). **If your draft
has more than ~15 bullets, you are enumerating — go back and merge.**

A 130-PR release and a 12-PR release should have Highlights and category sections of *similar
length*. The big release is more *selective*, not longer.

## How to cluster (three axes, in order of preference)

1. **Same API / feature area.** All `Span<T>` overloads across `SKMatrix.MapPoints`/`MapVectors`,
   `SKPath.AddPoly`/`SetRectRadii`, and the color filters → **one** bullet.
2. **Same platform / target.** All Uno / XAML view fixes → one bullet; all Blazor / WASM fixes →
   one; all "Metal on Apple" work → one.
3. **Same symptom / mechanism.** All view-leak / memory fixes → one; all packaging/nuget-layout
   changes → one.

Only the `[product]` lines are grouped — every `[internal]` line is dropped into the single
collapse line (see the writing rules). Bot-authored PRs may be grouped but never credited.

## Group titles are impact statements, not PR titles

- The **title** is the shipping impact — what the consumer gets — **not** a concatenation of PR
  titles: `` **`Span<T>` overloads across the point / path / color-filter APIs** ``.
- The **description** is one line on *why the consumer cares*, not a list of the PRs.
- All the group's PR links go in **one parenthetical at the end**, with each community
  contributor credited once: `❤️ [@a](url), [@b](url) ([#1](url), [#2](url), [#3](url))`.

## Categories (top-level `##` sections)

Pick the ones that fit; never force an empty category. Order by importance for the release.

`Engine & native dependencies` · `New APIs` · `GPU & Rendering` · `Text & Fonts` ·
`Views & platforms` · `Fixes` · `Lifecycle & Internals` · `Security`

The **Skia engine bump** (a "Bump skia" / "milestone" PR) always leads, under
`Engine & native dependencies`.

## Worked example — 3.116.0

The raw data lists these four `[product]` PRs separately:

```
[product] Add SKMatrix.MapPoints/MapVectors, SKPath.AddPoly overloads with Span<SKPoint> (#3030) @alexandrvslv
[product] Provide Span overload for SetRectRadii (#2949) @Youssef1313
[product] Add spans to the color filters (#2879) @mattleibow
[product] Added GetPixelSpan() with offsets (#2609) @mattleibow
```

❌ **Wrong (one bullet per PR):**

```markdown
- **Span<SKPoint> for SKMatrix.MapPoints/MapVectors and SKPath.AddPoly** — … ❤️ [@alexandrvslv](https://github.com/alexandrvslv) ([#3030](…))
- **Span<T> overload for SKPath.SetRectRadii** — … ❤️ [@Youssef1313](https://github.com/Youssef1313) ([#2949](…))
- **New color-filter span APIs** — … ([#2879](…))
- **GetPixelSpan() overloads with offset** — ([#2609](…))
```

✅ **Right (one grouped bullet):**

```markdown
- **`Span<T>` overloads across the point / path / color-filter APIs** — Zero-copy interop with stack-allocated buffers, for `SKMatrix.MapPoints`/`MapVectors`, `SKPath.AddPoly`/`SetRectRadii`, the color filters, and `GetPixelSpan`. ❤️ [@alexandrvslv](https://github.com/alexandrvslv), [@Youssef1313](https://github.com/Youssef1313) ([#3030](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/pull/3030), [#2949](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/pull/2949), [#2879](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/pull/2879), [#2609](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/pull/2609))
```

More groupings from the same release, so the page reads as ~18 bullets instead of ~56:

| #3093, #3089, #3081, #3087, #3086 | **.NET 9 Blazor / WASM fixes** |
| #2918, #2854, #2720, #2563, #2559, #2612 | **Uno / XAML view fixes** |
