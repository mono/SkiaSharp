# Release Notes Annotation

Annotate GitHub release notes with platform and community emojis.

## Process Overview

1. Get the release body
2. For each PR, determine platform and contributor status
3. Build categorized sections
4. Update the release

## Commands

### 1. Get Release Body

```bash
gh release view {tag} --json body -q '.body' > /tmp/release-body.md
```

### 2. Analyze Each PR

For each PR line (format: `* Description by @author in URL`):

```bash
# Extract PR number from URL and fetch details
gh pr view {number} --json labels,author,title,body
```

Determine:
- **Platform** from PR title/labels (required - use 📦 if none)
- **Contributor** — add ❤️ if author is not `mattleibow`
- **Breaking change** — title contains `BREAKING`, removes API
- **New feature** — title contains `Add`, `Support`, `Enable`, `Implement`, or bumps Skia/HarfBuzz
- **Backport** — title starts with `[release/{version}]` prefix (see below)

### 2a. Handle Backport PRs

Backport PRs have titles prefixed with `[release/{version}]` and are created by `@github-actions`. These should be traced back to the original PR for proper attribution.

**Identifying backports:**
- Title starts with `[release/...]`
- Author is `github-actions[bot]`
- Has `backport` label

**Tracing to original:**
```bash
# Get backport PR body - contains reference to original
gh pr view {backport-number} --json body -q '.body'
# Output: "Backport of {commit} from #{original-pr-number}."

# Get original PR details
gh pr view {original-pr-number} --json author,title,labels
```

**Annotation format for backports:**
```
* {emoji}{❤️} {clean title} (originally by @{original-author} in #{original-pr}) by @github-actions in {backport-url}
```

- Remove the `[release/{version}]` prefix from the title
- Add `(originally by @{author} in #{number})` before `by @github-actions`
- Use the **original author** to determine ❤️ (not github-actions)
- Use the **original PR** title/labels for platform emoji

### 3. Build Sections

- **Breaking Changes** — only if there are breaking PRs (list them here AND in What's Changed)
- **New Features** — only if there are feature PRs (list them here AND in What's Changed)
- **What's Changed** — always include, contains ALL PRs

Format all items: `* {platform}{❤️} Description...`

### 4. Update Release

```bash
gh release edit {tag} --notes-file /tmp/release-body.md
```
