  "body": "There has been no new release of a 1.68 svg nuget package. \r\nhttps://www.nuget.org/packages/SkiaSharp.Svg/\r\n\r\nThe last release is of 1.60.0. There has not been a release of a 1.60.3 version. This might be because there have been no changes in the svg part, but apparently there had been breaking changes in the shared part because if upgrade to 1.60.3 and use 1.60.0 for svg we get a method not found exception in our project ([Mapsui](https://github.com/mapsui/mapsui))\r\n\r\nWill there be a new release of the svg package?",
