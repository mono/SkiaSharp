  "title": "[QUESTION] What is the status of the svg nuget package?",
  "body": "There has been no new release of a 1.68 svg nuget package. \r\nhttps://www.nuget.org/packages/SkiaSharp.Svg/\r\n\r\nThe last release is of 1.60.0. There has not been a release of a 1.60.3 version. This might be because there have been no changes in the svg part, but apparently there had been breaking changes in the shared part because if upgrade to 1.60.3 and use 1.60.0 for svg we get a method not found exception in our project ([Mapsui](https://github.com/mapsui/mapsui))\r\n\r\nWill there be a new release of the svg package?",

        "body": "@Redth Perhaps it is possible to answer my main question without analyzing the exception. The roadmap of my project depends on it.\r\n\r\nMy question is about the status of the svg package. It is now not released in sync with the other releases. Why is that? I was thinking about an answer along there lines:\r\n- [ ] It is disbanded, no further updates.\r\n- [ ] It should work properly alongside the newer releases of the other skiasharp nugets, no further updates are needed.\r\n- [ ] There is going to be a newer release but we could not find time for it yet.\r\n- [ ] We have not decided whether we wil continue the svg package.\r\n",

        "body": "@pauldendulk apologies for the very long delay. The bits by Redth was the automated system, and then I missed this issue because it wasn\u0027t directly to do with this repo.\r\n\r\nSo... your questions. I _think_ this issue might not have to do with SkiaSharp - I think WPF might be loading the wrong native binary. Does this work with the older versions of everything?\r\n\r\nThen, the next question. You got it exactly here \u0022There is going to be a newer release but we could not find time for it yet\u0022. Unfortunately, various constraints lead this to be the case, but I am very much hoping to get some updates out. At the same time, this package is not really a real thing - more of a stop-gap until skia gets native support for SVG. I am not sure when this will actually come about as the code is both very experimental and fairly old: https://github.com/google/skia/tree/master/experimental/svg/model The main reason for this no-focus here is that this library is actually pretty limited and most of the issues have to do with not-complex-but-not-basic features missing.\r\n\r\nWith that said, I am trying to get the release to be more automated and less of a hassle - removing all excuses for updates. The last 2 weeks, we were moving the CI to Azure DevOps, so that is going to be a major reduction in friction. So far, the builds have been smooth.\r\n\r\nIn summary:\r\nWe want to, but effort is prioritised elsewhere.\r\nThen, there is the whole issue that this is not going to be the go-to library for SVG, but is more of an interim. Unless, we can get a major community effort behind this and then we can re-evaluate the focus.\r\nAnd then, I do want to see this be _somewhat_ useful to the community.",
