  "body": "helo,\r\n\r\ni was hoping to be able to draw svgs with a paints color that i provide with the DrawPicture() call, ie. overriding the style set in the file. i\u0027d like to load little icons as svgs and draw them in different colors on demand but it seems the drawing always takes the style saved in the file and only falls back to black when i remove the style from the file.\r\n\r\nor am i missing something?",
