  "title": "Draw Svgs with provided paints color",
  "body": "helo,\r\n\r\ni was hoping to be able to draw svgs with a paints color that i provide with the DrawPicture() call, ie. overriding the style set in the file. i\u0027d like to load little icons as svgs and draw them in different colors on demand but it seems the drawing always takes the style saved in the file and only falls back to black when i remove the style from the file.\r\n\r\nor am i missing something?",

        "body": "Thanks for this issue, but due the the fact that this library is now deprecated, no further work will be done on SkiaSharp.SVG.\r\n\r\nThank you for all of you folks that have been using this library this long, it is always great to know that some of my work has made things a bit better. However, I am unable to maintain this library, but I would recommend using the far superior https://github.com/wieslawsoltes/Svg.Skia \r\nIt has an API that is compatible and will just require a namespace change.\r\n\r\nFor better text support, I again would recommend the equally awesome https://github.com/toptensoftware/RichTextKit that can pretty much do everything.\r\n\r\nWith both of these, I have updated the sample app to demonstrate how to use these libraries, producing a far better result.",
