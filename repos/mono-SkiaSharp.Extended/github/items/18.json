  "body": "This implements support for clipPath elements, that can use rect, ellipse, circle, line and path elements to define clipping.\r\nAs I already mentioned in #13. all tests that compare specific bitmap pixels fail on my machine (ie. not only the tests I added, but also existing ones). I hope this is an issue on my machine only.",
