At least interpolation between four differently shaped objects work, so I am guessing colour change, rotation, scale and position will work too.",

The interpolation example, (https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp.Extended/tree/master/SkiaSharp.Extended#skpathinterpolation) is totally separate and is just basic interpolation between two \u0060SKPath\u0060 objects through the use of a new path. The animation is then done via a stepping manually through all the paths in the draw method.",
