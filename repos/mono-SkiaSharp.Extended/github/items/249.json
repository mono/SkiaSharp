  "body": "SkiaSharp.Extended is still a preview version but we want to use it in our project as a reference. Currently we need to disable the following warning, that our library release should not have a prerelease dependency. When can we expect a stable release of this package?\r\n\r\n\u003E A stable release of a package should not have a prerelease dependency. Either modify the version spec of dependency \u0022NuGet.Versioning [4.7.0-preview4.5065, )\u0022 or update the version field in the nuspec.\r\n\r\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/errors-and-warnings/nu5104 \r\n",
