  "title": "[QUESTION] Integrating SKLottieView into a UIViewController?",
  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI\u0027m currently working on integrating Lottie animations into my iOS application using SKLottieView. However, I\u0027m facing some challenges in properly displaying the SKLottieView within a UIViewController/UIView. I am looking for guidance on how to use  SKLottieView in the context of a UIViewController.\r\n\r\nBefore I dive into creating my own bindings for Lottie.iOS, I thought about giving SKLottieView a try. However, it\u0027s not as straightforward as I had hoped, especially since SKLottieView isn\u0027t exactly a drop-in replacement for UIView.\r\n\r\nHas anybody tried this so far?\r\n\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n[Register(\u0022SplashController\u0022)]\r\npublic partial class SplashController : UIViewController\r\n{\r\n    private SKLottieView _skLottieView;\r\n    \r\n    public SplashController() : base(\u0022SplashController\u0022, null)\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public override void ViewDidLoad()\r\n    {\r\n        base.ViewDidLoad();\r\n\r\n        _skLottieView = new SKLottieView();\r\n        _skLottieView.Source = new SKFileLottieImageSource()\r\n        {\r\n            File = \u0022splash_animation_ios.json\u0022\r\n        };\r\n        \r\n        View?.AddSubview(); // SKLottieView should be added here\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060",
