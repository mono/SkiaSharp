  "title": "[FEATURE] Look at integrating a higher quality resizing",
  "body": "By default, SkiaSharp aims for the fastest resizing, not the best. There are quality levels, but it pretty much is a low, medium and high type of level.\r\n\r\nThere was a discussion on skia-discuss about this: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/skia-discuss/2du6tuE3eds\r\n\r\nSeems there is a nice library that can be used to actually allow for a better quality: https://github.com/avaneev/avir\r\n\r\nProbably need to look at integration, licensing and alternatives for this kind of thing.",
