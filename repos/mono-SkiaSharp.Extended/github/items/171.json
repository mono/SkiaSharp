  "body": "**Description**\r\nThank you for building this maui plugin!\r\nMy animation is showing, but it is the wrong color.\r\nIt is displayed in blue on my Maui app (windows), but it should be pink.\r\nWhen I check my file by uploading the animation to lottiefiles.com I can see it in pink.\r\n\r\nThe original was blue (https://lottiefiles.com/97952-loading-anim\r\n[loading4pink.zip](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp.Extended/files/11687244/loading4pink.zip)\r\nation-blue), but I downloaded it with my own custom color.\r\n\r\nWhat could cause this? An unsupported effect used to re-color the animation?\r\nI added my downloaded version (with the pink color)  as a zip (cant upload .json)",
