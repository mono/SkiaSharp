The animations should load correctly, and there should be no noticeable issues with animation playback.\r\n\r\nIt has come to our attention that this issue has been open for a year now. We would like to inquire whether it has already been added to the backlog. We look forward to your support in resolving these issues promptly.\r\n\r\nCode snippet:\r\n\r\n            \u003CCarouselView.ItemTemplate\u003E\r\n                \u003CDataTemplate x:DataType=\u0022viewModels:FlashCardViewModel\u0022 \u003E\r\n                    \u003CGrid   RowDefinitions=\u002260*,40*\u0022\r\n                            ColumnDefinitions=\u0022*\u0022 \r\n                            ColumnSpacing=\u00220\u0022\r\n                            HorizontalOptions=\u0022Fill\u0022\r\n                            RowSpacing=\u00220\u0022\r\n                            VerticalOptions=\u0022Fill\u0022\u003E\r\n                        \u003CVerticalStackLayout\r\n                                Grid.Row=\u00220\u0022\r\n                                Grid.Column=\u00220\u0022\r\n                                HeightRequest=\u0022440\u0022\r\n                                WidthRequest=\u0022440\u0022 \u003E\r\n                            \u003Cskia:SKLottieView\r\n                                x:Name=\u0022LottieAnimationView\u0022\r\n                                HorizontalOptions=\u0022Center\u0022\r\n                                BackgroundColor=\u0022{Binding AnimationBackgroundColor}\u0022\r\n                                Source=\u0022{Binding AnimationFileName}\u0022\r\n                                RepeatCount=\u00220\u0022\r\n                                HeightRequest=\u0022440\u0022\r\n                                WidthRequest=\u0022440\u0022 /\u003E\r\n                        \u003C/VerticalStackLayout\u003E\r\n                    \u003C/Grid\u003E\r\n                \u003C/DataTemplate\u003E\r\n            \u003C/CarouselView.ItemTemplate\u003E\r\n        \u003C/CarouselView\u003E\r\n\r\n\r\n",
