If you still aren\u0027t sure about where to ask your question, then go ahead and ask here! We will try and answer you, but if we can\u0027t, then we will help you get the answers you want.\r\n\r\n--\u003E\r\nWhat is the right way to access the SKConfettiView in Xamarin.Forms? I\u0027ve searched for a nuget package without success, and the nuget SkiaSharp.Extended does not include this view.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your help\r\n",
