  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nI use SVGator for creating animated SVGs. However, .NET MAUI is not (yet) capable of playing animated SVGs.\r\nSVGator recently published an update that allows for the animations to be exported to MP4s.\r\nThere are other online services that are able to convert MP4s to lottie-files (json) by extracting the MP4s\u0027 frames to images and embedd them as base64 encoded jpges into the json.\r\n\r\nHowever, while the lottie website itself is able to show them, playing them with SkiaSharp.Extended from within a .NET MAUI application seems to be not possible.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you\u0027d like**\r\n\r\nI would like this plugin to be able to play this kind of animation the same way it is able to play regular lottie animations created with Adobe tools.\r\n",
