  "body": "I have some pretty basic SVGs that have their colors assigned in a style, but these will not render in SkiaSharp.\r\n\r\nIn the svg it has\r\n\u0060\u003Cstyle\u003E.cls-1{fill:#f9f9f9;}.cls-2{fill:#0066b2;}.cls-3{fill:#f9a533;}\u003C/style\u003E\u0060\r\nand when defining a path, those styles are referenced, eg\r\n\u0060\u003Cpath class=\u0022cls-3\u0022 d=\u0022M39.91,40.14,37.84,29.56a2.61,2.61,0,0,0-2.9-2.12H25.28l-.11.4a23.73,23.73,0,0,1,9.09,4.56A18.39,18.39,0,0,1,39.91,40.14Z\u0022/\u003E\r\n\u0060\r\nBut from what i can tell any SVG using styles (class) does not render correctly. All i get it everything in black. \r\n\r\nAttached is a simple visa card logo in SVG which doesn\u0027t wok with SkiaSharp.\r\n[visa1.zip](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp.Extended/files/1448832/visa1.zip)\r\n",
