  "body": "I have some pretty basic SVGs that have their colors assigned in a style, but these will not render in SkiaSharp.\r\n\r\nIn the svg it has\r\n\u0060\u003Cstyle\u003E.cls-1{fill:#f9f9f9;}.cls-2{fill:#0066b2;}.cls-3{fill:#f9a533;}\u003C/style\u003E\u0060\r\nand when defining a path, those styles are referenced, eg\r\n\u0060\u003Cpath class=\u0022cls-3\u0022 d=\u0022M39.91,40.14,37.84,29.56a2.61,2.61,0,0,0-2.9-2.12H25.28l-.11.4a23.73,23.73,0,0,1,9.09,4.56A18.39,18.39,0,0,1,39.91,40.14Z\u0022/\u003E\r\n\u0060\r\nBut from what i can tell any SVG using styles (class) does not render correctly. All i get it everything in black. \r\n\r\nAttached is a simple visa card logo in SVG which doesn\u0027t wok with SkiaSharp.\r\n[visa1.zip](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp.Extended/files/1448832/visa1.zip)\r\n",

        "body": "FYI there is a way around this for the moment, which is to re-save the SVG files with the CSS Properties set to \u0022Presentation Attributes\u0022, which means it doesn\u0027t use the css style class stuff and instead inlines the properties.  (Adobe Illustrator-\u003ESave As-\u003ESVG-\u003ESave-\u003E[More Options]-\u003ESVG Profile=SVG 1.1, CSS Properties=Presentation Attributes)\r\n\r\nSo the same path from the svg example above (resaved with presentation attributes) now works nicely with skiasharp and looks like this\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\u003Cpath fill=\u0022#F9A533\u0022 d=\u0022M39.9,40.1l-2.1-10.6c-0.2-1.4-1.5-2.3-2.9-2.1h-9.7l-0.1,0.4c3.3,0.8,6.4,2.4,9.1,4.6\r\nC36.8,34.4,38.7,37.1,39.9,40.1z\u0022/\u003E\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\nWould still be nice to get css support in future though :)",

        "body": "Thanks for this issue, but due the the fact that this library is now deprecated, no further work will be done on SkiaSharp.SVG.\r\n\r\nThank you for all of you folks that have been using this library this long, it is always great to know that some of my work has made things a bit better. However, I am unable to maintain this library, but I would recommend using the far superior https://github.com/wieslawsoltes/Svg.Skia \r\nIt has an API that is compatible and will just require a namespace change.\r\n\r\nFor better text support, I again would recommend the equally awesome https://github.com/toptensoftware/RichTextKit that can pretty much do everything.\r\n\r\nWith both of these, I have updated the sample app to demonstrate how to use these libraries, producing a far better result.",
