Please describe.**\r\n\r\nI wanted to know get the size of the canvas the Lottie was rendered on without having to peek at the json file.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you\u0027d like**\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if the event had an EventArgs type that gave us information about the animation. For my case it would be the size of the cavas.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you\u0027ve considered**\r\n\r\nMake an EventArgs type that is a dump of some useful information about the animation and the canvas.\r\n\r\n",
