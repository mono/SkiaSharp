The old way caused an issue in testing plus the property is only intended to change whether the control is animating and therefore does not need to update the source.\r\n\r\n\u003C!-- Describe any non-bug related behavioral changes that may change how users app behaves when upgrading to this version of the codebase. --\u003E\r\n\r\n**PR Checklist**\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has tests (if omitted, state reason in description) - I haven\u0027t work out how to test this part yet\r\n- [x] Has samples (if omitted, state reason in description)\r\n- [x] Rebased on top of main at time of PR\r\n- [x] Changes adhere to coding standard\r\n- [x] Updated documentation\r\n",

I wanted check that \u0060IsAnimationEnabled\u0060 prevented any progress updates but by calling \u0060CallUpdate\u0060 as the other tests do, that part doesn\u0027t rely on checks against \u0060IsAnimationEnabled\u0060 I think to trigger it otherwise I would need a mock \u0060Dispatcher\u0060 unless you have any ideas?",
