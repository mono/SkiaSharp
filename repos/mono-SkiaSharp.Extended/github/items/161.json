  "title": "FinishedAnimation equivalent for Lottie animations",
  "body": "I believe many people porting their Xamarin.Forms projects to MAUI are coming to SkiaSharp.Extended from Lottie.Forms, in order to use SKLottieView as a replacement for AnimationView.\r\n\r\nIn Lottie.Forms, AnimationView had an OnFinishedAnimation event. A typical use case would be displaying a popup to show an animation, then closing the popup automatically when the animation finishes.\r\n\r\nSkiaSharp.Extended doesn\u0027t appear to expose an equivalent event. What is the recommended way to satisfy the above use case?",
