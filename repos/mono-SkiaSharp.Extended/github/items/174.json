  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nWe have event \u0060SKLottieView.AnimationFailed\u0060 but we always show \u0060EventArgs.Empty\u0060 in [here](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp.Extended/blob/0ff98b0080b043e7e12aff3912f496f708acfd25/source/SkiaSharp.Extended.UI/Controls/Lottie/SKLottieView.shared.cs#L223). Better if user can know the reason why their lottie file is failed to load\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you\u0027d like**\r\n\r\n\u0060AnimationFailed\u0060 event should have reason why they are failed. Maybe event args with exception emitted?\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you\u0027ve considered**\r\n\r\nMaybe we can also just add \u0060Console.Writeline()\u0060 but I think it is better if we have reason animation failed emitted from \u0060AnimationFailed\u0060 event\r\n\r\n",
