  "body": "**Description of Change**\r\n\r\nJust Confetti for now, but Lottie also uses them and needs a bit extra. \r\n\r\nMost notably \u0060ExtendedTypeConverter\u0060 is now \u0060StringTypeConverter\u0060 because all it does is convert to and from a string. It has an internal ctor because it is just for internal use to have a compatible API for both Xamarin.Forms and Maui.\r\n\r\nAlso added a \u0060ResourceLoader\u0060 that is responsible for making sure the XAML resources are loaded into the app. This is also going to be used by Lottie.",
