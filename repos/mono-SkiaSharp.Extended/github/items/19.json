  "title": "Add support for text-anchor and baseline-shift",
  "body": "This adds support for text-anchor and baseline-shift attributes for text / tspan elements. The only limitation I see so far, is, that I can only handle the single text-anchor attribute on the enclosing text element. I ignore text-anchor attributes on tspan elements. \r\nI implemented this after adding clipping support (see #18), so it contains those commits as well. If that is a problem, please advice how I should prepare those commits for you.",
