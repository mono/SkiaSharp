  "title": "[Question] Using the build targets for custom typeface",
  "body": "Is it possible to use your IconifyGenerator for custom typeface fonts?  It doesn\u0027t appear to be included in the Nuget yet it would be a massive timesaver.  I think Refit do that as it is required for their code generation process, a situation that is similar to what you are doing here.\r\n\r\nAdmitedly, this is probably an advanced scenario which would require documenting unless you add an \u0060Attribute\u0060 to tag custom fonts classes and their matching data for parsing.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n",
