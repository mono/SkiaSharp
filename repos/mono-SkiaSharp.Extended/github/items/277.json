        "body": "Embedded images work for me with the latest preview updated, so this has definitly improved the usabilty alot. However, I do have some very severe performance issues with my animations that use embedded images. On my android test device the screen renderning goes from 60 Hz (under Xamarin.Forms with lottie) down to 7-12 Hz (with the same lottie animations but under maui).\r\n\r\nI testet a few things and removing some other elements gets the fps up to 20 but not 60. I created a small sample project with this issue to test. Maybe the way images are handled causes these performance problems. Here ist the issue, with a link to a sample project. Just press the button to get to the problematic animations:\r\nhttps://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp.Extended/issues/283",
