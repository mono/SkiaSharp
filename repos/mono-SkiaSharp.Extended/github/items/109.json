  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nI would like to override the stroke and fill colors of elements after the SVG file has been loaded.\r\nThere is no API to do this, and \u0060SKPicture\u0060 does not seem to have any public API to modify the colors in the cached drawing commands.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you\u0027d like**\r\n\r\nI would like to see some kind of callback to provide custom SVG styles or SKPaint as each element is \u0022drawn\u0022 to the SKPicture.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you\u0027ve considered**\r\n\r\nI am also looking at parsing the SVG files manually so that I can create a collection of \u0060SKPath\u0060 objects that can be drawn with my own SKPaint.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nI am using this library inside a \u0060SkiaSharp.Views.WPF.SKElement\u0060 to draw SVG icons on my UI. I would like to create a \u0060Color\u0060 property for the WPF control so that the icons can be recolored at runtime.\r\n",
