  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nwe from SVG.NET currently consider splitting SVG processing from drawing. See: https://github.com/vvvv/SVG/issues/590 and https://github.com/vvvv/SVG/issues/607\r\n\r\nIt would make quite a lot of sense to switch the rendering part to Skia. We also have a lot of rendering code that could probably changed from System.Drawing to Skia. So that might have to be evaluated.\r\n\r\nWe also have a nice test framework/application that works on pixel comparison. If anyone is willing to work together on that, let us know.",
