    "summary": "Duplicate of #3422. DllNotFoundException for libSkiaSharp in Blazor WASM on .NET 10. The .NET 10 WASM toolchain changed how native static linking works, breaking SkiaSharp's NativeAssets.WebAssembly integration. All SkiaSharp versions are affected.",
    "rationale": "type: DllNotFoundException is a clear runtime crash. The reporter describes something that previously worked (Blazor WASM with .NET 9) now failing after upgrading to .NET 10. This is broken behavior, not a usage question. area: The issue is in a Blazor WASM app using SkiaSharp. The root cause is the WASM static linking pipeline managed by SkiaSharp.Views.Blazor and NativeAssets.WebAssembly packages. The current label area/libSkiaSharp.native is less specific — the native binary itself is fine, it's the WASM linking integration that's broken. platforms: Reporter explicitly states platform is 'Blazor, WASM'. The current os/Windows-Classic label is incorrect — the issue is about WebAssembly execution in the browser, not Windows desktop. Windows is merely the development machine OS. tenets: tenet/reliability: DllNotFoundException causes complete failure. tenet/compatibility: This is a cross-version compatibility issue — SkiaSharp doesn't work with .NET 10's WASM toolchain. bugSignals.severity: Complete inability to use SkiaSharp in Blazor WASM on .NET 10. Workaround is to stay on .NET 9, which is viable but limits adoption. actionability.suggestedAction: A community member identified this as a duplicate of #3422, which tracks the exact same issue (DllNotFoundException/TypeInitializationException for SkiaSharp in Blazor WASM on .NET 10). The symptoms, platform, and root cause are identical. #3422 has more detailed reproduction and community discussion. regression.isRegression: SkiaSharp Blazor WASM worked on .NET 9 but fails on .NET 10. The regression is in the .NET WASM toolchain, not SkiaSharp itself — rolling back SkiaSharp versions does not fix it. versionAnalysis.currentRelevance: Issue affects all SkiaSharp versions on .NET 10 WASM. The root cause is a .NET 10 toolchain change, not version-specific, as confirmed by #3422 where even 2.88.x versions fail.",
