Swap the pointer assignments.\n\n2. **Destination pixel allocation.** The fast path writes into the destination's existing pixel buffer, but the current `CopyTo` contract allocates fresh pixels on the destination (via temp + Swap). If the destination is an empty `new SKBitmap()`, the fast path will fail or corrupt memory.\n\n3. **Alpha type and color space.** Matching `ColorType` alone isn't sufficient \u2014 two bitmaps with the same `SKColorType` but different `SKAlphaType` (Premul vs Unpremul) or `SKColorSpace` would produce incorrect colors with a raw memory copy. The fast path should verify these match too, or fall through to the canvas path.\n\n4. **Tests are needed.** The checklist shows tests unchecked \u2014 we'd need coverage for: contiguous same-type copy, subset bitmap copy, mismatched dimensions, and the canvas fallback path.\n\n5. **Coordination with #3317.** That PR fixes the shader disposal leak in the same method. Recommend merging #3317 first for the correctness fix, then rebasing this PR on top.\n\nThe per-row P/Invoke concern jeremy-visionaid raised is also worth addressing \u2014 you can compute the stride once from `RowBytes` and use `GetPixels()` + pointer arithmetic instead of `GetAddress()` per row."
