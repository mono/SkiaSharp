SkiaSharp 3.x uses `[LibraryImport]` for .NET 7+, but the generated declarations don't specify `Cdecl` calling convention. On x86 Windows, `LibraryImport` defaults to `StdCall`, while the native C API uses `Cdecl`. This stack corruption manifests as a stack overflow. On x64 there's only one calling convention, which is why it works there. On .NET Framework, SkiaSharp uses a different code path (`DllImport`) that correctly specifies `Cdecl`.\n\nWorkaround: target x64 instead of x86 if possible \u2014 the calling convention mismatch is invisible on x64.\n\nThe fix is to update the code generator to emit `[UnmanagedCallConv(CallConvs = new[] { typeof(CallConvCdecl) })]` alongside the `[LibraryImport]` attribute."
