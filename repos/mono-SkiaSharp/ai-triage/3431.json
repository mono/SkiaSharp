    "rationale": "This is a community PR fixing a confirmed type/bug in area/SkiaSharp.Views.Uno. The Skia backend of Uno's SKXamlCanvas uses a separate GCHandle-pinned byte array (unlike WinUI which gets pixels directly from bitmap.GetPixels()), so pixel and bitmap lifetimes must be independent. The fix is minimal and correct: split FreeBitmap() into FreePixels() and FreeBitmap(), reorder allocation so pixels are allocated first, and update DoUnloaded() to free both. CI is currently failing.",
