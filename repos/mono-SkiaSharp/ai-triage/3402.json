          "draftBody": "Thanks for the detailed write-up on what you're trying to achieve — the NES/SNES tile graphics use case helps a lot in understanding the requirements.\n\nThe challenge here is that Skia (the underlying C++ library SkiaSharp wraps) removed support for indexed color types several years ago. There's no `kIndex_8_SkColorType` or sub-byte format in modern Skia, so SkiaSharp can't expose what doesn't exist upstream. Adding 1/2/4bpp indexed formats with native pixel operations would essentially mean building a separate pixel processing engine outside of Skia.\n\nFor the tile atlas approach you're describing, a practical workaround would be to keep your indexed color data in custom `byte[]` arrays (packed at 1/2/4bpp) and only convert to a 32bpp `SKBitmap` at render time using a palette lookup. This is actually how most retro game emulators handle it — the compact storage stays in your own format, and the graphics library only sees the final expanded pixels. The conversion cost for a single screen's worth of tiles is minimal.\n\nAnother option worth considering is SixLabors.ImageSharp, which does support indexed/paletted pixel formats natively. You could use it for the pixel manipulation side and convert to `SKBitmap` when handing off to Avalonia for display.",
