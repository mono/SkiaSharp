    "rationale": "Classified as feature-request because the user explicitly asks for new pixel format support that has never existed in SkiaSharp. Area is core SkiaSharp since it involves SKColorType and the pixel pipeline. Skia upstream removed its last indexed format (Index8) in M61 circa 2017 (tracked in #568). The current SKColorType enum has no sub-8bpp or indexed types. Adding 1/2/4bpp indexed color would require either a custom pixel pipeline outside Skia or upstream Skia changes \u2014 neither is feasible for SkiaSharp to take on. The user's real need is compact storage and palette-based rendering for retro game tiles, which can be achieved with application-level indirection using existing SkiaSharp APIs.",

        "comment": "Thanks for the detailed explanation of your use case.\n\nSkia (the underlying C++ library) removed indexed/palette-based color types (Index8) back in 2017, and has no support for sub-byte pixel formats like 1bpp, 2bpp, or 4bpp. All pixel formats in Skia use at least 8 bits per pixel. Since SkiaSharp wraps Skia, adding these formats would require changes to Skia's core rendering pipeline \u2014 which is outside our scope.\n\nThat said, you can achieve compact palette-based tile rendering at the application level:\n\n```csharp\n// Store your palette\nvar palette = new SKColor[16]; // 4bpp = 16 colors\npalette[0] = SKColors.Black;\npalette[1] = SKColors.Red;\n// ...\n\n// Store tile indices compactly (1 byte per pixel, or bit-pack for 4bpp)\nbyte[] tileIndices = new byte[8 * 8]; // 8x8 NES tile\n\n// Expand to RGBA only when rendering\nvar info = new SKImageInfo(8, 8, SKColorType.Rgba8888, SKAlphaType.Premul);\nusing var bitmap = new SKBitmap(info);\nunsafe\n{\n    var ptr = (uint*)bitmap.GetPixels();\n    for (int i = 0; i < tileIndices.Length; i++)\n        ptr[i] = (uint)palette[tileIndices[i]];\n}\nbitmap.NotifyPixelsChanged();\ncanvas.DrawBitmap(bitmap, destX, destY);\n```\n\nFor sub-byte packing (4bpp/2bpp), you can pack multiple indices per byte in your storage format and unpack only when expanding to the render buffer. This keeps your binary storage compact while using SkiaSharp's standard rendering path.\n\nFor a NES/SNES-style tile system with 65K+ tiles, consider maintaining a small render buffer and only expanding the visible tiles each frame \u2014 the expansion cost for 8\u00d78 tiles is negligible.\n\nSee also #568 (the Skia M61 update that removed Index8) and #2383 (similar discussion about non-standard pixel formats)."
