    "summary": "This issue contains only the default bug template with placeholder text — no actual code, no expected or actual behavior, no screenshots, no logs. The title mentions images not appearing but provides zero actionable information. Cannot determine root cause or even confirm a real bug exists.",
    "rationale": "type: The reporter used the bug template and the title says '[BUG]'. While the content is empty, they claim something is not working ('images not appearing'). Keeping type/bug but with very low confidence since there is no actual evidence of broken behavior. area: No specific component mentioned. 'Images not appearing' is too vague to narrow down — could be core SkiaSharp, Views, or MAUI. Defaulting to the broadest area. platforms[0]: Reporter selected 'macOS' as platform. However, they also say IDE is 'Visual Studio (Windows)' which is contradictory — they may be developing on Windows targeting macOS, or this may be a template selection error. bugSignals.severity: Cannot assess severity without any actual details. No crash, no stack trace, no repro, no description of the problem beyond the title. Defaulting to low until more information is available. actionability.suggestedAction: The issue is entirely template placeholders. We need actual code, expected behavior, actual behavior, and ideally a sample project before any investigation can begin. platforms: Reporter selected macOS as the platform in the bug template. The IDE field says Visual Studio (Windows), which is contradictory — trusting the explicit platform selection over the IDE choice. regression.isRegression: Reporter selected 2.88.9 as last known good version, but the entire report is template placeholders with no actual details. This selection may not reflect real testing, so regression cannot be confirmed. versionAnalysis.currentRelevance: Reporter selected 3.116.0 and 2.88.9, but no details confirm whether a real issue exists. The version selections may be default template values rather than reflecting actual testing.",

      "hypothesis": "The reporter has code that should display images using SkiaSharp but nothing appears on screen.
