The NativeAssets.WebAssembly package IS for Emscripten, and Unity WebGL also uses Emscripten, so the approach is technically sound — the integration just needs different wiring than Blazor/Uno."

    "draft": "Hi @elephantpanda, thanks for the detailed writeup!\n\nThe `SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.WebAssembly` package does contain `.a` static archives compiled with Emscripten — the same toolchain Unity WebGL uses. So your approach is on the right track!\n\nThe difference is **how the `.a` files get linked**:\n- In **Blazor/Uno**, the .NET build system uses `NativeFileReference` to pass the `.a` files to Emscripten automatically\n- In **Unity**, you'd need to configure the Emscripten linker manually since Unity doesn't use MSBuild\n\nCould you share:\n1. Which Unity version and which SkiaSharp version you're using?\n2. How exactly you're placing the `.a` files in your Unity project? (which folder, any `.jslib` or linker configuration?)\n3. The full browser console error?\n\nThe key question is whether Unity's Emscripten version is compatible with the Emscripten version used to build the `.a` files. A version mismatch could cause linking failures.\n\nNote: Unity WebGL is not an officially tested target for SkiaSharp, but the underlying technology (Emscripten static linking) is the same as our supported Blazor WASM path."
