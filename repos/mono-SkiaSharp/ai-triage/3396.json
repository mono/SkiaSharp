    "draft": "Hi @elephantpanda, thanks for the detailed writeup!\n\nSkiaSharp doesn't officially support Unity, so this is unfortunately outside our supported scenarios. The specific issue you're hitting with WebGL is a fundamental architecture mismatch:\n\n- **Unity WebGL** uses Emscripten to compile to WebAssembly, and native plugins must be **statically linked** (`.a` files)\n- **SkiaSharp** uses .NET P/Invoke (`DllImport`) which expects **dynamically loaded** shared libraries (`.dll`, `.so`, `.dylib`)\n\nThe `SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.WebAssembly` package is designed for Blazor WebAssembly (which uses the .NET WebAssembly runtime), not Unity's Emscripten-based runtime. These are fundamentally different WASM environments.\n\nGetting this to work in Unity WebGL would require building Skia as a static Emscripten library and writing custom Unity native plugin bindings — a significant effort beyond what SkiaSharp provides.\n\nI'd recommend moving this to [Discussions](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/discussions) where the community can share any Unity-specific workarounds."
