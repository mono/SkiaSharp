    "summary": "Major build system modernization PR from the maintainer. Shifts the TFM chain forward two generations (net6→net8 becomes net6→net9→net10), replaces custom workload install scripts with built-in dotnet workload restore, removes a MAUI TPV workaround that's fixed upstream, updates CI pipeline tool versions, and fixes a latent bug where PlatformTargetFrameworksPrevious was referenced but never defined. Also adds a new documentation/updating-dotnet-version.md checklist to streamline future upgrades.",
    "rationale": "This is clearly an enhancement (not a bug fix or feature request) — it improves the existing build system rather than adding user-facing functionality. It's area/Build since all 48 changed files are build props, pipeline YAML, csproj TFM updates, and workload scripts. The tenet/compatibility label applies because TFM changes directly affect which .NET versions consumers can target. It directly addresses .NET 10 support gaps reported in #3422 (Blazor WASM) and #3428 (MAUI iOS).",
