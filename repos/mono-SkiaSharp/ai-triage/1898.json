    "summary": "Packaging bug in a 2021-era preview build where netcoreapp3.1 assemblies were missing from the SkiaSharp.Views.Forms NuGet package. The affected preview version is long superseded and .NET Core 3.1 itself is EOL. This issue is no longer actionable.",
    "rationale": "type: The reporter describes a concrete defect: a NuGet package that should contain netcoreapp3.1 assemblies has an empty directory. This is broken packaging behavior, not a feature request or question. area: The issue is specifically about the SkiaSharp.Views.Forms NuGet package having empty netcoreapp3.1 content. The package name is explicitly mentioned. bugSignals.severity: Missing assemblies means the package is broken for netcoreapp3.1 consumers, but it's not a crash or data loss — it's a packaging gap. Workaround exists by using an older preview or different TFM. actionability.suggestedAction: This affects only obsolete preview builds (2.88.0-preview.179) and a now-EOL framework (.NET Core 3.1). The stable 2.88.0 release and all subsequent versions have shipped. No action is needed. tenets: Empty netcoreapp3.1 directory in the NuGet package is a framework compatibility issue — the package advertises support for a TFM but fails to deliver assemblies. regression.isRegression: Reporter confirms netcoreapp3.1 DLLs were present in preview.127 but missing in preview.179, indicating assemblies were dropped between those preview builds. fixStatus.likelyFixed: The 2.88.0 stable release and all subsequent versions have shipped since this preview. .NET Core 3.1 is EOL (December 2022), making the affected configuration obsolete. versionAnalysis.currentRelevance: .NET Core 3.1 reached end-of-life in December 2022 and SkiaSharp 3.x is the current major version. The affected preview build is over 3 years old.",
