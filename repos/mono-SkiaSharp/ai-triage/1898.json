The 2.88.0 preview line was superseded by stable 2.88.x releases and then the 3.x series.\n\nFor anyone landing here now, the recommended path forward is to migrate to **SkiaSharp 3.x** with **SkiaSharp.Views.Maui.Controls** targeting `net8.0` or later.\n\nClosing this as the underlying package and framework are no longer supported.
