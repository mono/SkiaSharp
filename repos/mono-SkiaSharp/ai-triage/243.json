  "summary": "Feature request to bundle ANGLE (OpenGL ES over DirectX) with SkiaSharp for Windows desktop runtimes (WPF/WinForms). Originally filed for Win7 with DX9 support, the discussion evolved into how SkiaSharp could ship GPU-accelerated views for classic Windows desktop by packaging ANGLE as a separate NuGet dependency. SkiaSharp already has ANGLE interop code (GRGlInterface.CreateAngle, AngleSwapChainPanel for WinUI) and a Direct3D backend (GRContext.CreateDirect3D), but no GPU-accelerated views ship for WPF/WinForms.",

    "summary": "This is a long-standing feature request to ship ANGLE with SkiaSharp for Windows desktop. SkiaSharp already has significant ANGLE infrastructure (GRGlInterface.CreateAngle, AngleSwapChainPanel, GlesContext/Egl interop) but only for WinUI/UWP. WPF/WinForms views use raster-only rendering. Since filing, Skia gained a native Direct3D backend (GRContext.CreateDirect3D), which could be an alternative to ANGLE for GPU-accelerated desktop views. The maintainer discussed packaging ANGLE as a separate NuGet but noted DLL conflict concerns with AMD's system-wide libEGL.dll.",
    "rationale": "Classified as feature-request because no current SkiaSharp API or packaging is broken — the request is for new capability (GPU views for WPF/WinForms). Area is SkiaSharp.Views rather than Build because the core deliverable is GPU-accelerated view controls, not just packaging ANGLE. The existing label area/Build reflects the original framing but the discussion shows this is really about shipping new view infrastructure. Windows-Classic platform and OpenGL+Direct3D backends reflect the target surface area.",
