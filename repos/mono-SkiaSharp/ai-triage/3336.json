Area is area/SkiaSharp.Views because Egl.cs is part of the WinUI views GLES interop layer. Severity is medium: the code silently requests the COPY present path instead of the FAST path, which may degrade performance but doesn't cause crashes. The commenter molesmoke notes the fast path produces vertically flipped surfaces (non-conformant), so there may be behavioral implications beyond performance.",

Both `EGL_EXPERIMENTAL_PRESENT_PATH_FAST_ANGLE` and `EGL_EXPERIMENTAL_PRESENT_PATH_COPY_ANGLE` are set to `0x33AA` in `Egl.cs`, but the ANGLE spec defines FAST as `0x33A9`. All three display attribute arrays in `GlesContext.cs` reference the FAST constant, so the code has always been using the COPY present path.\n\nTwo options:\n1. **Fix the constant to `0x33A9`** — restores the intended fast present path (perf improvement), but surfaces become non-conformant (vertically flipped). As @molesmoke noted, `SKSwapChainPanel` itself handles this correctly, but direct `GRContext` users would need to set `GRSurfaceOrigin.TopLeft`.\n2. **Switch usages to `EGL_EXPERIMENTAL_PRESENT_PATH_COPY_ANGLE`** — preserves current behavior explicitly, no breaking change.\n\nLeaning toward option 1 since the original code comments describe it as an optimization, but this needs a decision on the breaking change."
