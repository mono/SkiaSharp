    "summary": "Reporter believes it's a bug that SkiaSharp.csproj doesn't include a ProjectReference to NativeAssets.Linux, but this is intentional. Unlike Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows, Linux has no platform-specific TFM (there is no 'net8.0-linux'). Additionally, Linux requires users to choose between two mutually exclusive variants: NativeAssets.Linux (with fontconfig) and NativeAssets.Linux.NoDependencies (no external deps). The version mismatch error occurs because a transitive dependency pulls in an old NativeAssets.Linux version, and no explicit PackageReference pins it to the correct version.",
    "rationale": "Classified as question (not bug) because the behavior is by design and documented in documentation/packages.md. The SkiaSharp.csproj correctly omits Linux because (1) there's no -linux TFM to condition on, (2) Linux has two incompatible native variants requiring user selection, and (3) auto-including would force unnecessary binary downloads. The reporter's proposed fix (adding a ProjectReference with Condition=\"$(TargetFramework.Contains('-linux'))\") wouldn't work because .NET doesn't have a -linux TFM. The actual fix is adding an explicit PackageReference to the correct NativeAssets.Linux variant in the application project. Area is libSkiaSharp.native because this is about native asset packaging and deployment.",

        "comment": "Thanks for raising this \u2014 it's a common source of confusion.\n\nLinux NativeAssets are intentionally not auto-included by the SkiaSharp package. Unlike iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows, .NET doesn't have a `-linux` TFM, so there's no condition to match on. Additionally, Linux has two mutually exclusive variants \u2014 `NativeAssets.Linux` (requires fontconfig for system font enumeration) and `NativeAssets.Linux.NoDependencies` (zero external dependencies, for containers) \u2014 so the user needs to choose which one fits their deployment.\n\nThe version mismatch you're seeing (native 88.1 vs expected 119.0) is because a transitive dependency is pulling in an old `NativeAssets.Linux`. Here's the fix \u2014 add an explicit reference in your **application** project:\n\n```xml\n<PackageReference Include=\"SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.Linux\" Version=\"3.119.0\" />\n```\n\nOr if you're in a minimal container / CI without fontconfig:\n\n```xml\n<PackageReference Include=\"SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.Linux.NoDependencies\" Version=\"3.119.0\" />\n```\n\nThis overrides the transitive version via NuGet's nearest-wins resolution. To identify which package is pulling in the old version, you can run `dotnet build --binary-logger` and inspect the binlog.\n\nThis is documented in the [NuGet packages documentation](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/blob/main/documentation/packages.md#auto-included-nativeassets) under \"Must be added manually.\""
