    "summary": "The reporter requests a 'Getting Started' section in README.md to centralize learning resources for new users. The README currently has badge links to API docs and guides in the header and a 'Using SkiaSharp' section with NuGet install instructions, but no curated onboarding section with tutorials or platform-specific guides. The request is straightforward documentation improvement.",
    "rationale": "Classified as type/documentation (not feature-request) because the ask is specifically about improving documentation content in README.md — no code changes needed. Area is area/Docs since it's purely about documentation structure. The request remains relevant: while the README has some doc links as badges, it still lacks the kind of curated 'Getting Started' section the reporter describes. Note that some of the specific links suggested by the reporter (Xamarin-era tutorials) may now be outdated and would need updating to current .NET/MAUI equivalents.",

A dedicated section with curated links would be a nice improvement.\n\nNote that some of the links you suggested (the Xamarin-era tutorials) have been superseded by newer .NET/MAUI resources. An updated version would want to link to the current Microsoft Learn documentation. If you're still interested in contributing this, a PR would be welcome."
