    "summary": "User is asking how to convert 24-bit RGB pixel data (System.Drawing.Imaging.PixelFormat.Format24bppRgb) to SKBitmap. This is a usage question about pixel format support — not a bug or feature request. Skia does not have a native 24bpp (3 bytes per pixel) color type, but SKColorType.Rgb888x provides 8 bits per RGB channel with an ignored padding byte at 4 bytes per pixel.",
    "rationale": "type: The title is literally phrased as a question ('Does skia supports...') and the body describes a goal the user wants to achieve, not broken behavior. No crash, no error, no incorrect output. area: Question is about core SKBitmap, SKColorType, and pixel data handling — all in the core SkiaSharp package. actionability.suggestedAction: The answer is straightforward: Skia has no native 24bpp format, but SKColorType.Rgb888x is 32bpp with ignored alpha, and users can convert 24bpp data to 32bpp then use SKBitmap.InstallPixels with custom stride. This can be answered directly.",
