  "title": "HarfBuzzSharp: Buffer is missing AddUtf16 method",
  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nI am currently in the works of a text layout for SkiaSharp and need to be able to configure the shaper to use UTF-16 indices instead of UTF-8. The only way to do that is adding UTF-16 values to the buffer instead of UTF-8. The shaper should use the current encoding to process the text properly otherwise clusters have the wrong indices.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nI would expect that the shaper uses the current encoding.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nUTF-8 is used all times.\r\n\r\n### Basic Information\r\n\r\n- Version with issue:  1.68.0\r\n- Last known good version:  -\n\n\u003E VS bug [#742852](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/742852)",
