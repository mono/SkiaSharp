  "body": "In WPF, when you draw for ex. circle using Path and set thick StorkeThickness, you are able to generate a new PathGeometry which contains is their segments also stroke (check [MSDN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.media.geometry.getflattenedpathgeometry?view=netframework-4.8)).\r\n\r\nHaving this PathGeometry you are able to check if hit (touched) point belong to specified Path (check [MSDN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.media.geometry.getflattenedpathgeometry?view=netframework-4.8)), and it works only for those places where this path is painted. \r\n\r\nI would like to do this exactly in similar way in SkiaSharp. \r\nWhen I touch canvas, I am able to detect proper SKPath (SKPath.Contains(x, y)) but this function relay on Rect, so when I have for example Circle and touch inside Circle, SKPath.Contains returns true.\r\n\r\nHow to achieve similar effect in SkiaSharp like in WPF ?\r\n\r\n\r\n",
