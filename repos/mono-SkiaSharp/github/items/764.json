  "body": "hello, i\u0027ve just read this update on [GPU migration](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/blob/v1.68.0/changelogs/SkiaSharp/1.68.0/gpu-migration.md) and i am wondering whether it is possible to create a shared GPU resource and use that to draw into it with SkiaSharp to use it further in a 3d application. what you basically need for that is the GPU handle to create a surface in DirectX or other 3d API\u0027s.\r\n\r\nhas anyone tried this before?",
