  "title": "[FEATURE] Implicit conversions between ValueTuples and SKPoint",
  "body": "### Is your feature request related to a problem?\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to specify points in an easier way.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you would like\r\n\r\nTherefore, I suggest adding an implicit conversion  between a ValueTuple and a \u0060SKPoint\u0060 as well as a deconstructor:\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060 c#\r\n// In struct SKPoint\r\n\r\npublic static implicit operator SKPoint((float x, float y) tuple) =\u003E new SKPoint(tuple.x, tuple.y);\r\n\r\npublic void Deconstruct(out float x, out float y) =\u003E (x = X, y = Y);\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\nThis would allow us to define a point as \u0060SKPoint point = (x, y);\u0060 instead of \u0060SKPoint point = new SKPoint(x, y);\u0060.\r\n\r\nThe inverse would also be possible: \u0060var (x, y) = point;\u0060.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you have considered\r\n\r\nIt is currently (C#12) not possible to declare an implicit operator as extension method.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project\u0027s Code of Conduct",
