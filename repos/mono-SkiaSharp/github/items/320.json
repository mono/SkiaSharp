  "title": "SKImage.Encode in Bmp returns null",
  "body": "When trying to encode an image in Bmp, it always returns \u0060null\u0060.\r\n\r\nI tried using different values for the quality from 0 to 100, knowing that anyway it does not make sense to have a quality in bmp, I actually thought it would just ignore it.\r\n\r\nHere\u0027s a sample that returns \u0060null\u0060.\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060cs\r\nvar bitmap = SKBitmap.Decode(File.OpenRead(filename));\r\nvar image = SKImage.FromBitmap(bitmap);\r\nvar data = image.Encode(SKEncodedImageFormat.Bmp, 100); // null\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\nAny idea how to make it work? I would like to avoid using the \u0060Bitmap.Bytes\u0060 as the goal is to be able to also use other encoding format.\r\n\r\nThanks",
