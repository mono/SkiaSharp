  "title": "[REGRESSION, iOS, 3.119.0] SKGLView malfunctions sometimes on iOS on newer iPads",
  "body": "### Description\n\nIn our game GnollHack, SKGLView malfunctions with drawing one large bitmap in 3.119.0 on iOS when using Apple iPad 13,17. Other iOS devices (iPhones and older iPad) we tested seemed to work fine, although this might have been just a lucky coincidence. Everything works in 3.116.1 on all iOS devices, and on all other platforms using both SKGLView and SKCanvasView.\n\n3.119.0:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34b6bbf0-1ab1-4b0c-a624-151cbd32f07f)\n\n3.116.1:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5200f03e-2052-4eee-87b1-ddea2d76dd04)\n\nWe subsequently downgraded SkiaSharp to 3.116.1.\n\n\n### Code\n\nSee the reproduction repository at https://github.com/hyvanmielenpelit/GnollHackMAUIEasyBuild\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nOn iPad 13,17, SkiaSharp 3.119.0 and 3.116.1 draw the screen in the same way.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nOn iPad 13,17, SkiaSharp 3.119.0 draws the screen only partially in a bugged way, while 3.116.1 draws it correctly.\n\n### Version of SkiaSharp\n\n3.119.0 (Current)\n\n### Last Known Good Version of SkiaSharp\n\n3.116.1\n\n### IDE / Editor\n\nVisual Studio (Windows)\n\n### Platform / Operating System\n\niOS\n\n### Platform / Operating System Version\n\niOS 18.4.1\n\n### Devices\n\nApple iPad 13,17\n\n### Relevant Screenshots\n\nSee the description.\n\n### Relevant Log Output\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060shell\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project\u0027s Code of Conduct",

        "body": "After I changed some drawing code a bit, this same problem appeared also on an iPhone 11 and iPhone 15 using SkiaSharp 3.116.1. It is caused by a (malfunctioning) ClipRect call after the background is drawn (perhaps a GL ordering issue?). As a workaround, I ended up removing ClipRect and clipping the text using my own code.",
