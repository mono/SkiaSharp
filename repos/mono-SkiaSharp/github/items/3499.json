We have mono/skia and mono/SkiaSharp.Extended. Investigate how we could do this. Maybe our cache should be moved into sub folders for each repo and then we have data generation that loads it all up and renders it. I would think we want a mix of all issues, and then filters to pick one or more of the repos. Investigate and think deeply. Design an amazing solution. Look at the instructions docs and memory banks for how we currently work. Then provide some good solutions and for each solution weigh up pros and cons. Pick the best solution and implement it.\n\n\n\u003C/details\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003C!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS --\u003E\n---\n\n\uD83D\uDCAC We\u0027d love your input!
