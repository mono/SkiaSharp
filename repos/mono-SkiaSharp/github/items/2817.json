  "title": "[FEATURE] Support Direct3D",
  "body": "### Is your feature request related to a problem?\n\n1. Some GPU or its driver doesn\u0027t support Vulkan.\r\nFor example, Intel Xe Graphics currently driver will return null ptr when get procedure address for some name.\r\nThen \u0060GRContext.CreateVulkan\u0060 will return null.\r\n2. Some environment only support OpenGL 1.1.\r\nFor example, Virtual Machine without GPU. Or remote control without RDP with Intel Xe Graphics.\r\nThen \u0060GRContext.CreateGl\u0060 will return null.\r\n\r\nWithout Vulkan and OpenGL, we can only use CPU to render images.\n\n### Describe the solution you would like\n\nAdd D3D support with Windows os.\n\n### Describe alternatives you have considered\n\nAdd define \u0060SK_Direct3D\u0060 when compile native skia so that I can use it with pinvoke and reflection.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project\u0027s Code of Conduct",
