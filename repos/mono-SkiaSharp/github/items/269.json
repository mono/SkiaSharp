        "body": "@gentledepp Thanks for the comments!\r\n\r\nAbout the tools, what I do for dev on the sources other than the actual binding is to just install the NuGets. The project is set up so that the build system can run through and throw errors if there is anything out of place. But, when doing more rapid/focused dev, such as the forms bits, I just delete the project references and install the SkiaSharp and SkiaSharp.Views NuGet into the projects. That way I can dev everything on Windows in VS.\r\n\r\nThe first issue is that if I change something in the binding project, I want the build to fail if I don\u0027t update the other projects. But as you found out, this is not very friendly for everyone else. I need to figure out a way to have a CI-style project setup as well as a human-style setup.",
