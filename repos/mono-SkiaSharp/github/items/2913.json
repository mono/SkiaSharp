  "title": "[WINDOWS, 3.0 Preview 3.1] SKGLView sometimes draws a horizontal red line across the screen on some GPUs",
  "body": "### Description\n\nSometimes on Windows, especially on integrated graphics cards on a laptop (Intel UHD Graphics), SKGLView draws randomly a red horizontal line across the whole screen. There\u0027s nothing red in the graphics being drawn, so this seems like some sort of a off-by-one bug or the like. A dedicated NVIDIA graphics card on the same laptop works fine. SKCanvasView also works fine. \n\n### Code\n\nhttps://github.com/hyvanmielenpelit/GnollHack\r\n\r\nYou generally seem to be getting the horizontal red line every now and then if you are using Intel UHD Graphics with SKGLView on Windows.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen using SKGLView on Windows, only the intended graphics specified in PaintSurface are drawn.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nWhen using SKGLView on Windows, a horizontal red line is sometimes drawn on the top of the graphics drawn in PaintSurface.\n\n### Version of SkiaSharp\n\n3.x (Alpha)\n\n### Last Known Good Version of SkiaSharp\n\nOther (Please indicate in the description)\n\n### IDE / Editor\n\nVisual Studio (Windows)\n\n### Platform / Operating System\n\nWindows\n\n### Platform / Operating System Version\n\nWindows 11\n\n### Devices\n\nWindows PC (a laptop with both Intel UHD Graphics and NVIDIA graphics card)\n\n### Relevant Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant Log Output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project\u0027s Code of Conduct",
