  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nThis Skia API function is not supported. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you\u0027d like**\r\n\r\nAdd support for this.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you\u0027ve considered**\r\n\r\nIt seems \u0060SKCanvas::drawImage\u0060 does *not* perform subpixel sampling, so e.g. fractional source cropping is not possible with it. It seems \u0060drawImageRect\u0060 can do this, at least that\u0027s what I understand from the comments.\r\n",
