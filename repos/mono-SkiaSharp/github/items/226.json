        "body": "It may be because the libraries were built on a previous run? The native bits take a long time to build, so I skip them on consecutive runs. To force a rebuild of them, there are a few things you can do:\r\n\r\n1. clean: \u0060./bootstrapper.ps1 -Target clean\u0060\r\n2. just delete the final libs: \u0060native-builds\\lib\\\u003Cplatform\u003E\\\u003Carch\u003E\u0060\r\n\r\nIf you are working on the native bits, I find it quicker to just temporarily comment out the check (the same for any platform):\r\nhttps://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/blob/6c235df4c8b92078a4cac8b1397e51a6002ab79c/cake/BuildExternals.cake#L152-L154\r\n\r\nAnd, you can also just do all your testing on a single arch by commenting out a few lines:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/blob/6c235df4c8b92078a4cac8b1397e51a6002ab79c/cake/BuildExternals.cake#L179 or for UWP https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/blob/6c235df4c8b92078a4cac8b1397e51a6002ab79c/cake/BuildExternals.cake#L216-L217\r\n\r\nThis way you only build one arch and the project files aren\u0027t rebuilt each time. This allows the project to be built with just the code changes, and not a full rebuild. (If you are making changes to the gyp, gypi or gn files, then you need to rebuild the projects.)",
