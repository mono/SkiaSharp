  "title": "[BUG]  Memory Leak on Window with Nvidia GPU driver",
  "body": "### Description\n\nWhen drawing patterns in wpf, a memory leak issue was encountered on the high resolution monitor.\n\nThere are variations for each GPU driver, so when I analyzed it, I found that it only occurred in the Nvidia Quadro series. \n\nI\u0027ve checked that it doesn\u0027t happen with the graphic card below.\n- Nvidia Geforce\n- AMD\n\nAssuming the Nvidia Quadro series was a problem, I tested it after adding the code below.\nWe have confirmed that the issue does not occur when we add the code below.\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n        protected override void OnStartup(StartupEventArgs e)\n        {\n           // Mode to turn off hardware acceleration and enable software rendering only\n           // Completely exclude GPUs and handle all screen outputs with only CPU operations\n            RenderOptions.ProcessRenderMode = RenderMode.SoftwareOnly;\n\n            base.OnStartup(e);\n        }\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n\nDue to the performance of other features of the current application, it is impossible to use the code above. How can I solve that problem?\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI always want to be a good draw without having a Memory Leak issue.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Version of SkiaSharp\n\n3.116.0 (Current)\n\n### Last Known Good Version of SkiaSharp\n\n2.88.9 (Previous)\n\n### IDE / Editor\n\nVisual Studio (Windows)\n\n### Platform / Operating System\n\nWindows\n\n### Platform / Operating System Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Devices\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant Log Output\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060shell\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project\u0027s Code of Conduct",
