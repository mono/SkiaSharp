  "title": "How to transform perspective of quadtrilateral to rectangle with skiasharp",
  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI would like to inquire about a missing feature in version 2.88.3, specifically the SetPolyToPoly() function. I am currently searching for a workaround to achieve the same result, and was hoping you could help?\r\n\r\nTo provide some context, I am working on a project involving a scanned receipt or paper. I am drawing it onto a canvas and selecting four points to represent the corners of the receipt, which are then stored as SKPoint[4]. These points form a quadrilateral shape, and I would like to transform or warp this shape into a rectangular one without excessively distorting the text. Through my research, I have found that SetPolyToPoly() is a commonly used function in Skia to accomplish this. But since its missing I was hoping you could show me if there any other way to do it with skiasharp or other ways\r\n\r\n\r\n",
