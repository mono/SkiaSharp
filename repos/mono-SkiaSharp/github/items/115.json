  "body": "I am busy updating to skia m52, but having issues when building ARMv6. As a temporary workaround, I am removing the armeabi ABI.\n\nIf this is needed, leave a comment and I can re-look at it.\n\nThe issue I am having is that when building for armeabi, the _ARM_NEON_ clang flag is defined, this results in linker error due to the fact that the code assumes that it can use NEON features.\n",
