As a result, the \u0022next\u0022 version should have PDF and GPU support. I am not sure if I will include the C# bindings for GPU just then, as it is more PDF-y. But, once the native bits are there, it will be easy to wrap. Basically, I am doing a bit of work for UWP as this is not yet Google-supported\n",
