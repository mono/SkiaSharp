Without HarfBuzz its more like a debug or something, not really useful in real app - only basic english alphabet is rendered correctly (so no localization), RTL/LTR is not observed, rendering text using harfbuzz results in much crisper result etc.\r\n\r\nSo you have to use Harfbuzz, split text into RTL/LTR/Neutral segments and each segment render separately using harfbuzz. My simplified version is 780 lines long and it is tied in my more complex framework which I wrote to create SkiaSharp multiplatform UI controls. Text drawing was one of most complex chalenges in this framework, really unexpected, at beginning it seemed so simple, just draw text usinng Canvas.DrawText. I started with Canvas.DrawText, then with extension DrawShapedText and now I wrote my own methods with RTL/LTR segments etc.\r\n\r\nAnother challenge is font fallback (useful when you combine more fonts - emoticons with latin script, arabic - you probably need 3 fonts) I cheated and merged used fonts into one.\r\n\r\nI don\u0027t know If I\u0027m doing it correctly, but seems to be working",
