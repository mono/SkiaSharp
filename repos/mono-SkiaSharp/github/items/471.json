  "title": "iOS: no touch.exit event fired",
  "body": "When overriding the OnTouch function in iOS, and the touch moves outside the view, there is never any touch event fired. Thus, it\u0027s impossible to tell if the finger has been released or not.\r\n\r\nThis is a Xamarin.Forms project and I do not see this problem in Android or UWP.\r\n\r\nMy view is inside a Master-Detail page, so it\u0027s possible that the Master-Detail hijacked the touch event, but then we should get a touch-cancelled event. I\u0027ll see if I have time to create a reproduction later this week, but it\u0027s pretty simple to create.\r\n\r\n",

I then put it into a master-detail page, and then the events stopped as soon as I moved horizontally.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if this is a bug with the Xamarin.Forms master-detail page hijacking events mid way, or if it is an issue with the SkiaSharp view.
