        "body": "I had a look and the reason nothing displays is because the canvas is in a vertical stack layout. This is not a problem exactly, but the real issue occurs because the canvas has no intrinsic size. The stack is asking the canvas for the size, the canvas says I have none and then the stack precedes to layout a 0 height stack.\r\n\r\nYou can probably use a grid or give the canvas a height. Let me know if this helps.",
