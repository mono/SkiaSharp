  "title": "[QUESTION] Exceptions vs error return codes, by design?",
  "body": "This is similar to question #743, but that was more than a year ago \uD83D\uDE09 \r\n\r\nDuring development, I noticed that sometimes exceptions are thrown (e.g. argument validation), but often \u0060null\u0060 references are returned when something goes wrong (like in the native Skia code).\r\n\r\nA .NET developer usually expects exceptions, so I guess either \r\n- this is not yet implemented?\r\n- the choice of using return values to indicate errors was by design (e.g. performance)?\r\n- the binding generator doesn\u0027t have enough metadata to generate exception wrappers (like SharpDX does)?\r\n\r\nAlso - suppose I would want to make PR for this - since the API must be backwards compatible, I guess any effort to make this library more \u0022.NET compliant\u0022 regarding exceptions, should be enabled by a run-time configuration toggle?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
