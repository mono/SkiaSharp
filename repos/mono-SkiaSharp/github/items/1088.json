  "title": "[FEATURE] Add missing SKRegion features",
  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nCompared to the original Skia SKRegion, SkiaSharps implementation is very basic and lots of methods are missing (Compare to https://skia.org/user/api/SkRegion_Reference).\r\n\r\nMost of the missing Methods are very easy to implement (f. e. translate(int, int), quickReject(SKRect), \u2026), but I think it would be nice if they are available by default.\r\nMost notable should be the absence of support for multiple rects within a SKRegion (skia calls this \u0022complex\u0022 mode). For example the \u0022setRects\u0022-Method is missing.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you\u0027d like**\r\nAdd missing Methods to SKRect to match functionality of original skia.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you\u0027ve considered**\r\nAs I said, most things are easy and can be hotfixed in managed code by using extensions. An exception is the complex mode which I think is very hard to handle right outside of Skia.\r\n",
