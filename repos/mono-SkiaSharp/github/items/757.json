        "body": "\u0060SkPDFImage\u0060 was removed in 2014 I believe and \u0060SkPDFBitmap\u0060 does not appear to be a sanctioned public API (these typically have the \u0060SK_API\u0060 \u0022modifier\u0022). But, this might not be useful in the general sense as it is basically just a set of helper methods for when an image is drawn to the PDF.\r\n\r\nIf you want to create a PDF document, use \u0060SKDocument\u0060. At this time SkiaSharp does not support loading PDFs.\r\n\r\nI would ask on the Google forums (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/skia-discuss) as they will know of all the secrets. They will either be able to point out the types (which I can expose if not already) or give any indication if this will be supported or not.",
