  "body": "This is the initial work to bring HarfBuzz to the current version and making it easier to update in the future. The library will no longer be downloaded as a zip file and instead was added as a submodule to the repository. The build process is almost the same and just the download part is removed. \r\n\r\nHarfBuzz itself is no on the current release version 2.3.1\r\n\r\nHarfBuzzSharp got some substantial additions but also has some breaking signature changes. The goal was to support more of the API and make it easier to integrate HarfBuzz into an existing application.\r\n\r\n\u003E VS bug [#774025](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/774025)",

The challenge is to produce the same results as the custom scripts do. For Windows and Linux that seems to work. For Android I had issues linking everything to a small dynamic library. In the end it isn\u0027t that easy. Using CMake is a good idea in general but probably a too big change for now. Only Mac is missing now and I will just hand edit the existing projects as I did with the rest. In terms of build tools nothing changed.\r\n\r\nMy current plan is to update the XCode projects by hand to finish the native builds. After that I will work on unit tests. ",
