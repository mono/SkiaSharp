  "title": "[UWP\u002BAndroid] wildly alternating touch co-ordinates",
  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nDuring a single move operation, I start to get alternating touch co-ordinates like this:\r\n\r\n    pt={X=156.8584, Y=207.1211}\r\n    pt={X=170.8299, Y=225.1194}\r\n    pt={X=157.8608, Y=208.1281}\r\n    pt={X=170.8504, Y=226.1232}\r\n    pt={X=157.8608, Y=209.132}\r\n    pt={X=171.8323, Y=227.1271}\r\n    pt={X=157.8435, Y=210.1358}\r\n    pt={X=171.8323, Y=228.1309}\r\n    pt={X=156.8616, Y=210.1185}\r\n    pt={X=170.8299, Y=229.1521}\r\n    pt={X=155.8592, Y=210.139}\r\n    pt={X=170.8472, Y=230.1355}\r\n    pt={X=154.8396, Y=210.1216}\r\n    pt={X=170.8267, Y=231.1566}\r\n\r\nThis is unfiltered, as it comes in via \u0060SKTouchEventArgs\u0060. It visibly alternates between two, parallel moving values.\r\n\r\nThe strange thing is that nearly two years ago, in a completely unrelated theme (but, obviously, calling the same underlying platform services as you do), I already saw some very similar behavior: https://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/74168/full-screen-image-viewer-with-pinch-to-zoom-pan-to-move-tap-to-show-captions-for-xamarin-forms It\u0027s mentioned in the accepted answer, it was observed in scaling back then but the mechanism was the same.\r\n\r\nI tried \u0060IgnorePixelScaling\u0060 but it isn\u0027t any different. The actual values differ, the jumping around is still there. This was logical, after all.\r\n\r\n### Basic Information\r\n\r\n- Version with issue:  1.60.3\r\n- Platform Target Frameworks:\r\n  - Android: ???\r\n  - UWP: 16299",

In the meantime, I replaced it with a more elegant version bases mostly on Petzold\u0027s article on MSDN (although expanded to cover more functionality) and there is no problem with that now. I could send you the control but, frankly, I don\u0027t know how interwoven it is with the rest of my app, whether it\u0027s easy to run it separately or not.",

As I mentioned, my current code doesn\u0027t show any such problems but even that older one linked didn\u0027t do any fancy stuff, just logged directly what came from the system. So, I suspect the fault was with the system, not my code that was and still is very straightforward. Let\u0027s allow this to sink to the bottom.",
