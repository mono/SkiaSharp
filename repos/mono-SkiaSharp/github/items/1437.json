  "title": "[QUESTION] Alpha channel in jpeg files",
  "body": "Hi,\r\nI am trying to open .blp files for a project I\u0027m currently working on. This file type has multiple formats, one of which contains embedded jpg data.\r\nThe problem I have is that this jpg data can have an alpha channel, but when I load the byte array using SkiaSharp, this information is lost. Instead of fully transparent white pixels, I\u0027m getting opaque black pixels. I tried using different SKColorSpaces and setting SKImageInfo.AlphaType, but nothing seems to work.\r\nAm I missing something, or is this simply not supported at the moment? If it\u0027s not supported, I\u0027d love to see this feature added.\r\n\r\nIn case you need it, I have some test files here: https://github.com/Drake53/War3Net/tree/master/tests/War3Net.Common.Testing/TestData/Blp\r\nThe file \u0022VillageFallStonePath\u0022 is the one with an alpha channel. The .blp file is the original, the .jpg I created by writing the byte array directly to a file, and the correct .png file I saved using a tool called BlpLab.\r\n\r\nRelated/additional reading:\r\nhttps://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/the-evil-that-is-blp.269997/\r\nhttps://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/blp-specifications-wc3.279306/",
