  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nImagine n SKGLControls \u002B m OffScreenRenderings yielding SKImages with n, m in N\u00B0.\r\nIs there a way of having the OffScreenRenderings GPU accelerated on a Windows Desktop application?\r\n\r\nI thought maybe for that we need ANGLE or Vulkan Backends for that, but unsure why the OpenGL would not deliver the expected performance. Then again I am not so familiar with OpenGL and on how to handle MakeCurrent OpenGL calls. Can I expect a performance boost when using those two fancy backends?\r\n\r\nThe updates on these two threads look promising! Big up!\r\n#243 !  \r\n#252\r\n\r\nMaybe related:\r\n#688 ",
