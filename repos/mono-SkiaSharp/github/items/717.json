Then again I am not so familiar with OpenGL and on how to handle MakeCurrent OpenGL calls. Can I expect a performance boost when using those two fancy backends?\r\n\r\nThe updates on these two threads look promising! Big up!\r\n#243 !  \r\n#252\r\n\r\nMaybe related:\r\n#688 ",

        "body": "It should be possible, see https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/issues/688.\r\n\r\nBasically, the GL controls create their own OpenGL context for rendering. If you want to do independent off-screen rendering, you need to create your own OpenGL context and start drawing on a new surface. I do that as part of my unit tests for GPU: https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/blob/master/tests/Tests/GlContexts/Wgl/WglContext.cs\r\n\r\nAt this time, the Vulkan and Metal backends are not yet implemented, nor feature complete. ANGLE is really only implemented on UWP because OpenGL works fine on the Win32/desktop world.",

        "body": "Closing this as the question has been answered: Yes, offscreen drawing is a thing that can be done. OpenGL should be fine as it is a Windows feature. ANGLE/Vulkan may not have that much of an improvement.\r\n\r\nIssue #688 has code for iOS and UWP, but you could have a look at other Windows implementations - such as what they do for OpenTK or at the SkiaSharp Windows tests: https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/blob/master/tests/Tests/GlContexts/Wgl/WglContext.cs",
