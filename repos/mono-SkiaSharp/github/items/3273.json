        "body": "Well I found it may caused by the caching issue. At first I made a mistake, I used the interactiveAuto mode in blazor, but when i switched to interactiveWasm, it still doesn\u0027t work until l clear all the cache both in browser and the project folder. Then I run dotnet restore before I run it in debug mode, it works.",

Just there appears the error and I have to close it each time I start the app.\n\nEdit: after properly cleaning and rebuilding, I no longer had this issue.",
