  "body": "Tried rendering with SKCanvas on iOS and the resulting raster is vertically flipped (as if origin is bottom-left corner and Y grows up). I worked around this by concatenating scale/translation matrices to the canvas.\n\nThis vertical flipping is most likely some OS X related default being applied on iOS?\n",
