(install gcc,gcc-c\u002B\u002B 4.8.5) to be utilized to bootstrap compiling to the latest 9.* version via source.\r\n\r\nCentOS 7 Steps\r\n\r\n1) Upgrade GCC,GCC-C\u002B\u002B (Steps are online).\r\n2) Reboot\r\n3) Run these commands to fix actual issue for error list above.\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n#cd /usr/local/lib64\r\n#cp libstdc\u002B\u002B.so.6.0.29 /usr/lib64/\r\n#cd /usr/lib64/\r\n#mv libstdc\u002B\u002B.so.6 libstdc\u002B\u002B.so.6.OLD\r\n#ln -sf libstdc\u002B\u002B.so.6.0.29\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading gcc, I was able to get a self-contained published .net core 2.2 app working on centos 7 server.\r\n\r\nI have gotten it to work on dotnet (FDD and SCD) deployment models.\r\n\r\n",
