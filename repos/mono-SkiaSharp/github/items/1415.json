        "body": "Thanks for raising this. It should have been a Create* variant. Just like you see in the docs, people create a new object and then call set. It was to reduce that into a single create.\r\n\r\nI think I forgot to add it. \r\n\r\nBut for now, if you need it, then it should be fine to use it. I was cleaning up the API surface to make it more consistent, but no loss in functionality or less performance.\r\n\r\nIf you don\u0027t want to use obsolete things, then you can also create a \u0060Translate.Concat(Scale)\u0060 matrix. (not sure about the order offhand). It is the same thing.",
