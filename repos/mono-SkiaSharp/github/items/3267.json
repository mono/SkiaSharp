I update to \u00603.119\u0060 then got a crash on Windows7.\n\nSkiaSharp even doesn\u0027t depend on OpenGL, it can use CPU to render by default, but added a D3D12 dependency, is this a good idea?\n\n\u003Cimg width=\u0022257\u0022 alt=\u0022Image\u0022 src=\u0022https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cab45c6-fb0e-44bf-bbb3-f14f09906f43\u0022 /\u003E\n\u003Cbr/\u003E\n\u003Cimg width=\u0022329\u0022 alt=\u0022Image\u0022 src=\u0022https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/faf1f464-bfc1-4ff0-9dc3-e0bd6334ed00\u0022 /\u003E\n\u003Cbr/\u003E\n\u003Cimg width=\u0022400\u0022 alt=\u0022Image\u0022 src=\u0022https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f0e8e3a-2e46-430c-aa73-98fdcde89992\u0022 /\u003E\n\n### Code\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060cs\nusing SkiaSharp;\nnamespace SkiaSharpCrashTest\n{\n   internal class Program\n   {\n      static void Main(string[] args)\n      {\n         Console.WriteLine(\u0022Before\u0022);\n\n         // Force to load libSkiaSharp.dll\n         var fontMgr = SKFontManager.Default;\n\n         Console.WriteLine(\u0022After\u0022);\n      }\n   }\n}\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Version of SkiaSharp\n\n3.119.0-preview.1.2\n\n### Last Known Good Version of SkiaSharp\n\n3.118.0-preview.2.3\n\n### IDE / Editor\n\nVisual Studio (Windows)\n\n### Platform / Operating System\n\nWindows\n\n### Platform / Operating System Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Devices\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant Log Output\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060shell\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project\u0027s Code of Conduct",

        "body": "This has nothing to do with Win7 systems. Just like OpenGL, D3D12 should be treated as a dynamic dependency of Skia, not a direct dependency. Without manually turning it on, Skia uses CPU rendering by default, D3D12 is mostly idle, and a direct dependency adds bulk and introduces compatibility issues.\n\nThere are also many computers that only have D3D11, like Win8, or have glitches in D3D12. It shouldn\u0027t cause numerous compatibility issues because of a less common dependency. That\u0027s not a good software engineering design solution.",
