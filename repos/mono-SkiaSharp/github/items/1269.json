  "title": "[QUESTION] Performance of SKImage via SKCodec and SKSurface vs. SKBitmap",
  "body": "Q1) I use \u0060SKCodec\u0060 to read image (need \u0060EncodedOrigin\u0060), then create and \u0060SKImage\u0060 from that using \u0060SKImage.FromPixelCopy(codec.info, codec.Pixels)\u0060. Question: Is there a faster way of doing this? As I read it as a double up on memory there even though data is immutable.  E.g. if \u0060SKCodec\u0060 could expose the data using e.g. \u0060ReadOnlySpan\u003C\u003E\u0060.\r\n\r\nQ2) Also i use \u0060SKSurface\u0060 for drawing (mostly scaling and filters) instead of \u0060SKBitmap\u0060 as that is newer/better - true? Or is that only true when GPU is available (I am doing all on server/asp.net).",
