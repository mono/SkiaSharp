If you still aren\u0027t sure about where to ask your question, then go ahead and ask here! We will try and answer you, but if we can\u0027t, then we will help you get the answers you want.\r\n\r\n--\u003E\r\n\r\nis it normal for 1 pixel wide borders to not be drawn?\r\n\r\nthis is what i get on MacOS\r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/b6ZqeE2\r\n\r\nand this is what i get on android\r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/X3zE9rt",
