Please describe.**\r\nI\u0027m using the \u0060dev/update-m80\u0060 branch of \u0060mono/skia\u0060 library directly, without C#, but doesn\u0027t found metal/vulkan related apis in \u0060include/c/gr_context.h\u0060, \r\nand i knows that there is vulkan binding landed in \u0060xamarin-develop\u0060 branch recently, will it be merged to \u0060dev/update-*\u0060 branch? or i should just use \u0060xamarin-develop\u0060 branch?\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you\u0027d like**\r\nI\u0027d like the \u0060mono/skia\u0060 library supports both vulkan and metal.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you\u0027ve considered**\r\nI currently using opengl on all platforms, and also \u0060google/angle\u0060 library on windows.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.\r\n",

        "body": "Thanks for asking this. Actually, the skia \u0060xamarin-develop\u0060 is the later branch and that should be used instead of \u0060dev/update-m80\u0060 (which is going to be deleted soon). This goes with the SkiaSharp \u0060develop\u0060 branch.\r\n\r\nMetal is coming soon, I think it is just a few APIs to add.\r\n\r\nVulkan has landed and is available on Win32, Linux and Android.\r\n\r\nFor use of ANGLE on Windows, we currently create views just for UWP, but do you also use it on Win32?",
