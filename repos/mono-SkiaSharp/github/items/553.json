Unfortunately the font is available for Skia only after restarting the App. Is it somehow possible to force SKFontManager to pick up newly installed fonts?\r\n\r\n### Code\r\nI\u0027m trying:\r\n\u0060SKTypeface.FromFamilyName()\u0060\r\n\u0060SKFontManager.FontFamilyCount\u0060\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nDon\u0027t know if it\u0027s possible for SKFontManager to pick up new fonts which are installed when the skia is running.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\u0060FontFamilyCount\u0060 doesn\u0027t change and \u0060FromFamilyName\u0060 returns the default font.\r\n\r\n### Basic Information\r\n\r\n- Version with issue:  10.60.1\r\n- Windows Classic:  Windows10",
