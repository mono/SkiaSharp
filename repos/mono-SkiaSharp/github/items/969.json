I implement [Pdf rendering with SkiaSharp](https://github.com/alexandrvslv/pdf-clown) and to paint \u0022Tiling Pattern\u0022 requires [SkPictureShader](https://github.com/google/skia/blob/master/src/shaders/SkPictureShader.h) \r\n\r\nIt will be great to see bindings for this type of shader.\r\n\r\nLet me know what the best solution is: make pull request by myself or fork project.\r\n",
