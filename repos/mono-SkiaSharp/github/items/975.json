  "body": "With .Net Core 3 coming up soon, has there been discussion on implementing .Net Core with SkiaSharp.Views? \r\n\r\nRight now I am using version 1.68.0 for my Net Core cross platform project. It gives me the warning \u0022Package was restored using .NETFramework...\u0022. It still works, but seeing that .Net Core is supposed to replace any new and upcoming projects from being created in NetFramework, it would be important to have a functioning version of SkiaSharp.Views available.\r\n",

        "body": "\u002B1 on that title \uD83D\uDE09 \r\n\r\nThis will also be 50% there with 1.68.1. I have separated the WPF and WinForms views into a separate NuGet package:\r\n - https://www.nuget.org/packages/skiasharp.views.wpf\r\n - https://www.nuget.org/packages/skiasharp.views.windowsforms\r\n\r\nThis will still have the warning, but should work much better without having to use bulky views package. Right now, it will pull in _both_ WPF and WinForms - and GTK.\r\n\r\nIf you are doing .NET Core on Linux and want views, we also got: https://www.nuget.org/packages/skiasharp.views.gtk3",
