I was able to debug ios emulator, ios physical device.\r\n\u003E \u003E \u003E In my environment, I have VS professional 16.10, where I code... and VS enterprise 16.9.2 where I build iOS :D\r\n\u003E \u003E \u003E PS: if you want to spend some time, you can try downgrading VS one version at a time, maybe you find a newer version than 16.9.2 which works. Since I only tried 16.9.6 which didn\u0027t work and then I switched to 16.9.2, which worked for me before.\r\n\u003E \u003E \u003E Hope this helps.\r\n\u003E \u003E \r\n\u003E \u003E \r\n\u003E \u003E What version of Skiasharp are you using?\r\n\u003E \u003E Because I already downgraded to Vs 16.9.2, and debug on emulator only works but not on real devices.\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E SkiaSharp.Views.Forms 2.80.2 :)\r\n\r\nThanks, I just noticed I was using 16.9.6 instead of 16.9.2, seems this is what Im going todo today ;-)",
