  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nThis is very hard for me to reproduce in a sample application. I use Draw path to draw polygons with multithreading. If I create a path in the same thread, add a polygon to it and then draw it immediately, I get an access violation exception. This only happens in release and not in debug. So it is very hard to reproduce as well. Can someone who knows the internal code tell me where I can start to reproduce this problem in debug. Also IS there any work around to avoid the crash.",
