  "title": "Encode multiple SKBitmap objects as a GIF",
  "body": "Hello.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to encode a bunch of SKBitmap objects as a GIF? Alternatively, is it possible to make a GIF out of a directory full of PNG files on disk using this library? It is possible I am just missing something online and maybe you can point me in the right direction.\r\n\r\nAs an aside - I have been using this library for the last few days with .net core and I have to say that it is extremely awesome! I\u0027ve worked with the Skia in C\u002B\u002B as well, but these C# bindings truly save me a lot of time and are so simple to use. Thanks! :)",
