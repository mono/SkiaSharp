  "body": "https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/blob/0adc4b8988b379382a09301c401c3fca80cc3323/binding/Binding/MathTypes.cs#L78\r\n\r\nWhen calculating the reflection of a vector, shouldn\u0027t the dot product be between the vector and the noramlized one? Like this: \r\n\r\n\u0060var dot = point.x * normal.x \u002B point.y * normal.y\u0060\r\n\r\nLet\u0027s say we have a vector with coordinates \u006010,10\u0060 and we have a normalized vector with coordinates \u00600,1\u0060, by using this method to calculate the reflection we get a vector with coordinates \u006010, -390\u0060 which is kind of weird in my opinion, maybe I am wrong.",
