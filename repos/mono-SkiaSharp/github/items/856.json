I want to be able to draw an icon in my forms project using a icon in my respective drawable folders from my android project and resources in iOS project\r\n\r\nWhat would the implementation look like for this in the Forms project? \r\n\r\nI was also looking into the sample project and it looks like a media folder is created and images placed in there but i am hoping to use the icons in my platforms respective resource folders.",
