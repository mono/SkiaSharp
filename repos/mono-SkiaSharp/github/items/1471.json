  "body": "Hi @mattleibow hope you\u0027re doing well... I\u0027ve using SkiaSharp a lot since a couple of years (thanks for your great work!)\r\nI have a project where it requires a lot of font usage... I see a problem with memory consumption if I load fonts from a Stream like this basic template\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060csharp\r\nvar s = new SKMemoryStream(File.ReadAllBytes(@\u0022c:\\Windows\\Fonts\\georgiab.ttf\u0022));\r\nvar tf = SKTypeface.FromStream(s);\r\nusing (var paint = new SKPaint())\r\n{\r\n   paint.Typeface = tf;\r\n}\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\nI notice that disposing the paint obj will not dispose the specified SKTypeface nor the Stream associated to it. I\u0027ve read [this old post](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/pull/386) and need you provide me some hints about how to deal with it... Do I have to create some font cache and then forcing the disposition of each cached obj as proposed in that post? or am I misreading it? Any suggestion will be very welcomed! thanks in advance\r\n",
