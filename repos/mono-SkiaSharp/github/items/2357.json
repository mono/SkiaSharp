  "body": "Hi.\r\n\r\nI\u0027d like to know if you are aware and if you know how to deal with the following:\r\nSkiaSharp, that has a MIT license, use HarfBuzz that has a Old-MIT license. HarfBuzz use several components (Cairo, FreeType2, GLib, google-benchmark, Ragel). Some of them are LGPL-2.1 but the last one, Ragel, is GNU GPL.\r\nIn a commercial product how do you deal with this situation? \r\nSome tips are welcome.",
