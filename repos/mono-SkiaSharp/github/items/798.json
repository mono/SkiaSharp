  "title": "[QUESTION] [Android] SKGLView lags and has worse performance when rendering Path compering it to iOS",
  "body": "Currently, I am trying to create a custom SKGLView that supports pan and zoom out of the box. The SKGLView renders paths that contain a great amount of points (**more than 10000**). As the SKGLView uses the OpenGL for rendering **I expect the performance to be much better than the SKCanvasView** - **and it is on iOS, but not on Android.** On Android I am still observing some lag when the canvas is panned. Attached you can find a sample project that demonstrates my current setup. I am testing on real devices - Pixel and Nexus 5X.\r\n\r\nCould you please, let me know if I have missed something in my implementation that makes the view lag on Android? Are there any tools that I can use to profile my application or some tricks I need to know when the SKGLView is created? I was not able to find a detailed documentation how to work with the SKGLView and I apologize if my question is irrelevant. \r\n\r\nAny help is highly appreciated. Thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n[SkiaPanAndZoom.zip](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/files/2901551/SkiaPanAndZoom.zip)",
