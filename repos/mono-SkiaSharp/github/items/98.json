  "body": "SKCanvas is missing a scale function overload that allows to specify the x- and y- center of the scale operation.\n\nInterestingly, I could not find this in the Skia source code at\nhttps://github.com/google/skia/blob/master/include/core/SkCanvas.h\n\nbut as I am replacing Android.Canvas api calls, where the Android.Graphics.Canvas class has this overload (and it is internally using Skia itself, I guess) there should be a way to implement this... :-|\n\nCan I achieve this in any other way? (I am not so good at matrix operations, sorry for that)\n\nI am using 1.49.4-beta\n",
