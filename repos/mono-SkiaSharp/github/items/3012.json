So a bit crazy and not as much SkiaSharp was released.\r\n\r\nBut, should be up and running now and they appear to be on the feeds. Both the 2.x and 3.x changes. I am preparing... hopefully next week... to release a new preview to nuget with this. I think this will also need to update some targets files for blazor  as that does not have the magic selection logic. And then also the SIMD and/or multithreading logic: https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/pull/2620\r\n\r\nBut, that is for another sleep second.",
