I fixed that issue in fd88f1add7954b3d428e9bcf251b8d064080ebca\n\nLet me know how things go.\n\nAlso remember that you don\u0027t have to build SkiaSharp to use the samples. Right now the code that will work out the box is v1.54.1: https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/releases/tag/v1.54.1\n\nThe master is the almost-finished bits for the next v1.55 - the samples want the later version of the NuGet, so you will have to build everything, but the samples in v1.54.1 will work with the v1.54.1 NuGet.\n",

Did you clone the submodules too?\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThe submodules are skia and the build tools to actually compile all those pieces. SkiaSharp is just the managed wrapper, and we use MSBuild for that. skia is a lot of C/C\u002B\u002B code, and we just build the library using Google tools.\n\nYou can check to see it the submodules are downloaded under the \u0060externals\u0060 folder, there should be \u0060skia\u0060 and \u0060depot_tools\u0060 folders with lots of files.\n",
