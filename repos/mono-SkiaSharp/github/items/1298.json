  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nCurrently SkiaSharp Views for UWP are based on the \u0060Windows.UI.Xaml.*\u0060 namespaces.\r\n\r\nIn the future, WinUI will become the recommended UI base library for new .net applications (both for Win32 apps and UWP apps). This library makes use of the \u0060Microsoft.UI.Xaml.*\u0060 namespaces.\r\n\r\nMixing the Windows-bound namespaces with the decoupled namespaces is likely impossible.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you\u0027d like**\r\nA version of SkiaSharp that is able to be used in WinUI apps.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nhttps://microsoft.github.io/microsoft-ui-xaml/\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml",
