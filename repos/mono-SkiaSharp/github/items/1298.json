Please describe.**\r\nCurrently SkiaSharp Views for UWP are based on the \u0060Windows.UI.Xaml.*\u0060 namespaces.\r\n\r\nIn the future, WinUI will become the recommended UI base library for new .net applications (both for Win32 apps and UWP apps). This library makes use of the \u0060Microsoft.UI.Xaml.*\u0060 namespaces.\r\n\r\nMixing the Windows-bound namespaces with the decoupled namespaces is likely impossible.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you\u0027d like**\r\nA version of SkiaSharp that is able to be used in WinUI apps.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nhttps://microsoft.github.io/microsoft-ui-xaml/\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml",

I don\u0027t think the Skia team has made any decisions yet on future plans to completely move to just WinUI 3 and not support UWP at this time.\r\n\r\nFor instance for the Windows Community Toolkit our main code is still based on UWP. We ship previews alongside the WinUI 3 previews for folks to try out ahead of time, which is what this issue is alluding to. For our previews, we currently only support Win32 Desktop WinUI 3 previews (as WinUI 3 UWP doesn\u0027t support .NET 5 yet officially). Once WinUI 3 ships and supports both Desktop and UWP environments on the latest .NET, then we\u0027ll move our Toolkit development over to the new base.",
