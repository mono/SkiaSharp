  "title": "Can SkSvg display an SVG with custom fonts?",
  "body": "We\u0027re using SkSvg successfully to display our SVGs, but need to display an SVG which has text with a custom font.\r\n\r\nHowever, SkSvg is not displaying with the correct font - it\u0027s using the nearest font it can find.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to use SKFontManager to register our custom fonts with SkiaSharp so that SkSvg can access it? Or am I misunderstanding how SKFontManager is meant to work?",

        "body": "The font manager looks at the fonts that are installed on the device. You can manually load fonts using \u0060SKTypeface\u0060, but there will be no way to tell the parser to use them.\r\n\r\nAt this point, if you really want to use SKSvg, I would suggest converting the text to paths. \r\n\r\nAnother option would be to check out a far better SVG implementation that has many more features: https://github.com/wieslawsoltes/Svg.Skia. @wieslawsoltes has been hard at work on this and probably has support for custom typefaces by now.",
