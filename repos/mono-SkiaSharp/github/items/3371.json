        "body": "That\u0027s an interesting point - there\u0027s nothing on the dotnet side at build time that requires an OS version-specific TFM. However, the native DLL for 3.119 is built against DX12, so it won\u0027t run on on the TFM default OS version (7.0). On that basis, specifying net8.0-windows10.0.19041 seems reasonable (though I note that MS did publish a Win 7 compatibility package for DX12). The downstream package currently also wouldn\u0027t work as expected for net8.0-windows (i.e. Windows 7.0).",

        "body": "I have also encountered similar issues when referencing both [LiveChartsCore.SkiaSharpView.WPF](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LiveChartsCore.SkiaSharpView.WPF/) and [ScottPlot.WPF](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ScottPlot.WPF/). When I tried to upgrade LiveCharts, I ran into versioning problems.\n\nAlthough I\u0027m using the default .NET 7.0, both packages work fine on Windows 11. However, enforcing strict version requirements creates another problem: new projects with default NuGet settings may not find my package. To maximize compatibility, there seem to be two options: use the same version as ScottPlot (2.88.9) or upgrade like LiveCharts and let downstream users handle the versioning.\n\nBut honestly, this doesn\u0027t seem ideal. The 7.0 requirement is just a minimum; it doesn\u0027t mean the package only works on Windows 7. This is more of a .NET ecosystem issue\u2014strict versioning mostly affects UWP and WinUI, which are now mostly deprecated.\n\nGiven this, perhaps it\u0027s better to remove the strict version limitation to encourage a more flexible and thriving ecosystem. Of course, this is just my perspective. I\u0027m interested to hear your thoughts on this as well.",

AFAIK, the SkiaSharp bindings themselves don\u0027t use any APIs from 10.0.19041 at build time - but it does have a transitive build dependency because of the native Skia part being built against DX12.",
