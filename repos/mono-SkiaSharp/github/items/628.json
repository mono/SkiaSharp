        "body": "Right now, there is no real plans to create a rendered view for watchOS. This is due to low demand and also, no easy way to create a watchOS view. Typically, the SkiaSharp views derive from some \u0060UIView\u0060 or OpenGL view, but none exist on the watch.\r\n\r\nI did some looking around and I found that people just created a \u0060UIImage\u0060 and then used an image view to display it. You can do the same with SkiaSharp and the \u0060SkiaSharp.Views.watchOS\u0060 namespace extension methods:\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060csharp\r\n// sue normal SkiaSharp\r\nvar bitmap = new SKBitmap(100, 100);\r\n// \u2026 draw \u2026\r\n\r\n// use the extension methods to convert the SkiaSharp image to a watchOS image\r\nvar image = bitmap.ToUIImage(\u2026);\r\n\r\n// display\r\nimageView.SetImage(image);\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\nI have a full sample here: https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/blob/v1.60.3/samples/Basic/watchOS/SkiaSharpSample.OnWatchExtension/InterfaceController.cs",
