  "body": "I have just created a new Windows Forms .NET Framework 4.6.1 project, added SkiaSharp nuget package (2.80.2), and the native bins (libSkiaSharp.dll) are not deployed to the output directory. \r\n\r\nI have tested with this small project to check why I could not get it to work in my other project, which is a .NET Framework Windows Forms that depends on a .NET Standard 2.0 class library that then depends on the SkiaSharp.\r\n\r\nI am compiling as AnyCPU. I assume this issue was solved...\r\n\r\nI am using Visual Studio 2019, 16.10.0\r\n\r\n[SkiaDemo.zip](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/files/6706216/SkiaDemo.zip)\r\n",
