  "title": "Question: how to get OpenGL backend working on linux",
  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nHow can I get an OpenGL context on Linux/GTK#? I\u0027ve tried encapsulating a SKSurface inside an OpenTK.GLWidget (GTK#), but GRGlInterface.CreateNativeGlInterface() always returns null, even if the OpenGL graphics context (X11) is created and initialized correctly by the GLWidget.\r\n\r\nI\u0027ve already searched through skia forums and other sites. I suspect that skia doesn\u0027t have a GRGlInterface generator for Linux, is that correct? \r\n\r\nMy native library was compiled with all GPU bits enabled.\r\n\r\nCPU drawing is working nicely on Linux/GTK# through a Gtk.EventBox. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance.
