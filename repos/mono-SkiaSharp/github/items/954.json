        "body": "From [Nuget\u0027s history of SkiaSharp builds](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SkiaSharp/), we see that updates to SkiaSharp have been getting less frequent, starting with one or two builds a month in 2016, to not a single build this year. Last year the frequency was about once every two or three months.\r\n\r\nSkia is actively in development and there are several fixes that are urgently needed by users of SkiaSharp. Could we please get back to a more predictable cycle of SkiaSharp builds?\r\n\r\nThank you very much.",

There are 115 issues in \u0022Needs Triage\u0022 but 0 issues in \u0022In Progress\u0022. A total of 255 issues were fixed since the project began in early 2016. There were no checkins to the \u0022master\u0022 branch in the past two months.\r\n\r\nGiven this backlog, could we please have a response? Making a project open source is only part of the story; a clear roadmap and timelines are equally important. Additionally, Xamarin enterprise customers depend on this component.\r\n\r\n@migueldeicaza @mattleibow \r\n\r\nThank you very much.",
