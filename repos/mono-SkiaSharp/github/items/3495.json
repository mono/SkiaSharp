  "body": "This pull request updates the branch naming convention across several documentation and workflow files. The standard for feature and update branches is changed from \u0060copilot/issue-NNNN-description\u0060 or \u0060copilot/update-{dep}\u0060 to \u0060dev/issue-NNNN-description\u0060 or \u0060dev/update-{dep}\u0060. This ensures consistency and clarity in branch naming for all contributors.\r\n\r\n**Branch naming convention updates:**\r\n\r\n* Updated instructions in \u0060.github/copilot-instructions.md\u0060 to use \u0060dev/issue-NNNN-description\u0060 instead of \u0060copilot/issue-NNNN-description\u0060 for feature branch creation.\r\n* Changed branch creation steps in \u0060.github/skills/add-api/SKILL.md\u0060 to use the new \u0060dev/issue-NNNN-description\u0060 naming.\r\n* Modified checklists in \u0060.github/skills/add-api/references/checklists.md\u0060 to reflect the new branch naming convention.\r\n* Updated bug fix workflow in \u0060.github/skills/bug-fix/SKILL.md\u0060 to use \u0060dev/issue-NNNN-short-description\u0060 for branch naming and pushing.\r\n\r\n**Native dependency update workflow changes:**\r\n\r\n* Standardized all references to update branches in \u0060.github/skills/native-dependency-update/SKILL.md\u0060 from \u0060copilot/update-{dep}\u0060 to \u0060dev/update-{dep}\u0060 throughout instructions, tables, and checklists.
