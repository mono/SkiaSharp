  "body": "I can\u0027t find any information on how to generate a debug build? \r\n\r\nSince Skia doesn\u0027t have a debug layer like DirectX, Vulkan or OpenGL, sometimes it is insanely hard to track down why a function returns \u0060false\u0060 or \u0060null\u0060.  So having a debug build can be very handy.\r\n\r\nIs it just a matter of passing \u0060-c Debug\u0060 to \u0060./bootstrapper.ps1\u0060? That didn\u0027t seem to work for me, but maybe something else went wrong.\r\n\r\n",
