  "body": "This is similar to: [SkiaSharp Text Size on Xamarin Forms](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42717021/skiasharp-text-size-on-xamarin-forms#42726320)  \r\n\r\nThe question: How does the TextSize property on an SKPaint object relate to the \u0027standard\u0027 Windows Forms FontSize on **windows desktop**?\r\n\r\n![4kv69](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1067952/31968625-0134a66a-b912-11e7-85f2-93213b248489.png)\r\n\r\nIn the screenshot you see left the text as rendered by SKCanvas  (which has no scaling applied) and right i put the windows system dialog \u0022userdefined scaling\u0022 for comparison where you see that the string \u00229-Punkt Segoe UI\u0022 is written significantly larger. Also my dpi settings are at 100%. \r\n\r\nIn the question referenced above, @mattleibow answers with applying a scaling factor but doesn\u0027t clarify what the variables mean, in the code he shows:  specifically what does \u0022viewWidth\u0022 refer to?  \r\n\r\n    var scale = canvasWidth / viewWidth;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
