        "body": "There are 2 types of pdb files, the debug which is several hundred MB each and the release which is also pretty size-y (somehow a 80-90MB comes to mind...). We could use a symbols package that you opt into - like with snupkg or symbols.nupkg (whatever the new trend is) - but I am not sure if that applies to native code (I\u0027ll have to check).\r\n\r\nBut this has been on my mind for some time though. What/how does the other projects in the community deal with this? Does anyone know of an example of this that I could look at or crack open and see the secrets?",
