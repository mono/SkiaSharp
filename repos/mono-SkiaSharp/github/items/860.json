  "title": "[QUESTION] .NET Core on-screen rendering",
  "body": "Hi. I\u0027m interested in creating desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux) GUI app with .NET Core and SkiaSharp. Unfortunately .NET Core samples are only showing how to render to offscreen canvas and save result to file. There are some examples like WPF and WinForms but they aren\u0027t cross-platform.\r\n\r\nCan we do on-screen rendering with SkiaSharp in .NET Core? If yes, does it benefit from hardware acceleration?\r\n\r\nI want very basic 2D rendering, not something like Avalonia.\r\n\r\nThanks.",
