  "body": "## Summary\n\nImproves Phase 5 (Create PRs) of the native-dependency-update skill to prevent common mistakes.\n\n## Changes\n\n- Add **branch naming convention table** for quick reference\n- Add **numbered sub-steps** for SkiaSharp PR creation\n- Add **\u26A0\uFE0F CRITICAL callout** for submodule update requirement\n- Add **Phase 5 completion checklist** to verify all steps before proceeding\n- Use natural language instead of rigid bash scripts for flexibility\n\n## Why\n\nDuring a libwebp update, I made these mistakes:\n1. Used wrong branch naming (\u0060libwebp-1.6.0\u0060 instead of \u0060dev/update-libwebp\u0060)\n2. Forgot to update the \u0060externals/skia\u0060 submodule in the SkiaSharp PR\n3. Didn\u0027t cross-link the PRs\n\nThe previous instructions had these issues buried in prose, making them easy to miss when moving quickly.",
