  "body": "### Description\n\nWhen I create an ipa file it does not include the libSkiaSharp.framework.dSYM symbols\n\n### Code\n\nThe best way to share code for larger projects is a link to a GitHub repository: https://github.com/user/repo/tree/bug-123\r\n\r\nBut, you can also share a short block of code here:\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060cs\r\n// some C# code here\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\nYou can also share some XAML:\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060xaml\r\n\u003C!-- xaml code here --\u003E\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI expected it to be either generated by visual studio and tried several configurations to no avail and also I would have expected the symbols file would be part of the nuget packages for the platoforms\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nno symbols available in the build output\n\n### Version of SkiaSharp\n\n3.116.0 (Current)\n\n### Last Known Good Version of SkiaSharp\n\n2.88.9 (Previous)\n\n### IDE / Editor\n\nVisual Studio (Windows)\n\n### Platform / Operating System\n\nAndroid, iOS, Windows\n\n### Platform / Operating System Version\n\nWindows 11\n\n### Devices\n\nwindows 11 pc\n\n### Relevant Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant Log Output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project\u0027s Code of Conduct",
