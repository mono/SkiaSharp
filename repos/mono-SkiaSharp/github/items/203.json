  "body": "Hey guys, awesome project you got here! NGraphics and XamSVG now feel obsolete :))\r\nAnyways during playing with SkiaSharp I noticed I cannot get my svg\u0027s (imported via the prerelease SkiaSharp.Svg) painted in any other color than default black (on UWP, didn\u0027t try other platforms yet). The DrawPicture call completely ignores the color I set for the paint object. Is this a bug or am I doing something wrong?",
