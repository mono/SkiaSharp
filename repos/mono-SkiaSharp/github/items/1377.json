        "body": "Thanks @vpapenko for reporting this and thanks @daltonks  for the workaround.\r\n\r\nThis is a weird thing. Looking at the code, I am listening to the size event in the underlying UWP control. And I am requesting a redraw there too.\r\nhttps://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/blob/master/source/SkiaSharp.Views/SkiaSharp.Views.UWP/AngleSwapChainPanel.cs#L158-L179\r\n\r\nHowever, it looks that when the view changes, triggers a redraw, the underlying GL surface has not yet been recreated yet, so it is the old size. I think forms runs a little later, so it has had time to recreate the GL surface.\r\n\r\nI\u0027ll have a look and see if there is some other event that needs to be subscribed to in order to get notified when the actual GL surface changes.",
