  "body": "Hello, I am a developer using xamarin.forms.\r\nI have a question about a problem while drawing text through skiasharp.\r\nFirst of all, I apologize for my lack of English skills.\r\n\r\nI\u0027m currently using 1.68.3 version.\r\n\r\n\u0060string[] skFontFamily = SkiaSharp.SKFontManager.Default.GetFontFamilies();\u0060\r\n\r\nUse the code at the top to load the Default font.\r\nThe uwp and android normally produce a default font string[].\r\nHowever, for ios, the number of strings[] is always returned to zero.\r\nWhat kind of mistake am I making?\r\n",
