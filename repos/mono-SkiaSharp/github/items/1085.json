  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI want to use this library in a Xamarin.Forms project.\r\nI\u0027m trying to put a bit map in a polygon shape (like your example: Show Non-Affine Matrix)\r\nbut this way I\u0027m losing the swipe gestures on the map itself.\r\nIs it possible to achieve both (maybe with absolut layout somehow)?\r\n\u002B When a release the finger when finished to move one of the vertices, is there a way to convert the screen location to a longitude, latitude coordinate?",

        "body": "I am not too sure about the maps. I would ask on the Xamarin.Forms repo. I also think they have/should have the ability to make the pins / polygons on the actual map using the map framework. The effort to draw polygons over a map is not going to be worth it - also there will always be some lag and offsets. Most mapping controls have the ability to do fairly complex things.",
