        "body": "@charlenni thanks for trying this out.\n\nOn Windows, did you init the submodules? The \u0060externals\u0060 folder should have two large folders: \u0060skia\u0060 and \u0060depot_tools\u0060.

Although I don\u0027t have this issue with that part of the build script, mine occurs when building the source. It appears Microsoft changed something with NuGet and there was a bug in mono. These two together create issues for some packages when you restore in a \u002B# timezone: https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/3089 (there are a few others).\n\nTo get around this issue, you can either drop your timezone to a -#. Or, you can manually download and extract the https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.FileHelpers/ NuGet into the \u0060/tools/Addins/Cake.FileHelpers\u0060 directory.
