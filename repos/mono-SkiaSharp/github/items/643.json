  "title": "SKTypeface.FromFamilyName returns null",
  "body": "My app uses the Avalonia library to show UIs on ARM devices. Avalonia internally uses SkiaSharp. I have a strange behavior on the Raspian system where SKTypeface.FromFamilyName returns null if one passes a font family name that does not exist.\r\nThe authors of Avalonia say it is expected to return the default font of the system. Unfortunately this unexpected null crashes the application during the application startup.\r\n\r\nAny idea what is going wrong here?\r\nIs this an issue with SkiaSharp, Skia or the specific operating system?\r\n\r\nI use a self built libSkiaSharp 1.60.3 with .NET Core 2.1 on Raspian 9.4\r\n",
