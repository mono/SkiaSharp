  "body": "I am currently trying to get Skiasharp to work on an openshift container that was provided to me. There are certain restrictions placed on the container and because of that I do not have the rights to change the image at all and hence I cannot add any additional configurations to it. The problem that I have been running into seems to be that I keep getting the dll not found issue and the only workaround\r\n![error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11401905/54687224-70b51480-4af1-11e9-9935-a1b9682d2a39.PNG)\r\n recommended in the forums was including the .so, which I did and I still seem to be getting the same issue. \r\nThere also seems to be some additional dependency on libfontconfig but I have no way of installing that on my container because of the restrictions placed on it. Is there any viable solution that you could suggest? \r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.  \r\n",
