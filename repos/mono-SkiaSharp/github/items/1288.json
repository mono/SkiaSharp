        "body": "This might be more tricky than it sounds. One really needs to track the memory usage of the [underlying shared pixel buffer](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/\u002B/master:third_party/skia/include/core/SkPixelRef.h)\r\n\r\nE.g. extracting a subset bitmap, or any call to [\u0060SKBitmap::setPixelRef\u0060](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/\u002B/master:third_party/skia/include/core/SkBitmap.h;drc=6931add57da6fb7bde407366874fa26051c62263;bpv=1;bpt=1;l=754?originalUrl=https:%2F%2Fcs.chromium.org%2F) shares the same memory\r\n\r\nSo ideally, the \u0060SKPixelRef\u0060 should be tracked, that would cover a lot of cases; it would be handy if that native class had some global alloc\u0027d/free\u0027d events \r\n\r\n",
