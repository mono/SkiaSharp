        "body": "@mattleibow this is related to the OPS onboarding for the API docs ... the system apparently needs to check out all submodules (probably just as a generic process), and it was failing because there\u0027s no default branch info, and mono/skia doesn\u0027t have a \u0060master\u0060 branch. Adding this default branch to the submodule config works around the issue ... though please let us know if that\u0027s the correct branch to use as the default.",
