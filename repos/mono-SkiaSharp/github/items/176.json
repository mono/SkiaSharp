  "title": "Add convenience members to SKPoint/SKSize/SKRect",
  "body": "Some cool members might be:\n- [x] center of a rectangle (ie: \u0060rect.MidX\u0060)\n- [x] ~~percent of a size (ie: \u0060size * 0.5f\u0060 or \u0060size / 2f\u0060)~~\n- [x] ~~scaling rectangles (ie: \u0060rect * 2\u0060)~~\n- [x] fit a rect inside another rect (ie \u0060rect.Fit(anotherRect, fitStyle: shrink/grow/shrinkOrGrow)\u0060)\n\nLeave comments to share what you might think useful, and I will see if I can add them.\n",

        "body": "I added some methods to SKRect:\n- \u0060Standardized\u0060 (return a rect that has the left \u003C right and top \u003C bottom)\n- \u0060AspectFit(Size)\u0060 and \u0060AspectFill(Size)\u0060 to fit/fill a size inside a rect\n\nScaling is a bit harder, as a single value cannot show if it is going to be the width/height or actually the whole rect. \u0060Inflate()\u0060 is probably good enough.\n\nIt might also be better to create separate issues for each new member (track progress)\n",
