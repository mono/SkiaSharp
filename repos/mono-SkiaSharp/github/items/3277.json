  "body": "Cancel/close this issue!\n\nNevermind - this is a NON-ISSUE.  The \u0022SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.iOS\u0022 is a \u0022transitive package\u0022 which automatically gets included when I select 3.119 for \u0022SkiaSharp\u0022 main package.\n===================\n\n\n### Description\n\nWe tried to migrate our iOS/Android app from SkiaSharp 2.89 to 3.119 today, but ran into an issue where it won\u0027t show us the \u0022SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.iOS\u0022 option for 3.119, which appears to be caused by our app targeting \u0022.net8.0-iOS18\u0022 while this package support is only labeled for \u0022.net8.0-iOS17\u0022.\n\nIf we try to manually force install it from the PkgMgr Console, it yields rejects it here too for the same reason.\n\nWe\u0027d rather not roll back our whole project to iOS 17, for sake of SkiaSharp, as we are supposing here that this is just a meta-data fix to make this work.\n\nSo this issue is two-fold:\n1st: Want to make sure our assumption is correct, that the current \u0022SkiaSharp.Native.iOS\u0022 package is all set for iOS18.\n\nand\n\n2. Would like to have the package compatibility updated to allow for iOS 18.\n\n\n### Code\n\nn/a\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nExpect:  iOS18 compatible support\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nActual: Only support up to iOS17 currently.\n\n### Version of SkiaSharp\n\n3.116.0 (Current)\n\n### Last Known Good Version of SkiaSharp\n\n2.88.9 (Previous)\n\n### IDE / Editor\n\nVisual Studio (Windows)\n\n### Platform / Operating System\n\niOS\n\n### Platform / Operating System Version\n\niOS 18\n\n### Devices\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant Log Output\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060shell\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project\u0027s Code of Conduct",
