  "title": "[3.116.1; MAUI x64 Android emulator] SkiaSharp does not draw lines and circles",
  "body": "### Description\n\nLine drawing (e.g. lines and circles) do not function on MAUI using SkiaSharp 3.116.1 when drawn on x64 Android emulator (x64). They do work in Xamarin (emulator or not, 2.88.8; ARM64 and x64) and in MAUI on Android real device (ARM64).\n\n### Code\n\nI was testing Android x64 behavior with my game GnollHack for use with Google Play Games on PC, but in fact using a local Pixel 7 emulator first.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nLines are drawn on just like on real Android device using ARM64.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nLocal x64 Android Pixel 7 emulator does not draw lines or circles, but most other things are drawn successfully.\n\n### Version of SkiaSharp\n\n3.116.0 (Current)\n\n### Last Known Good Version of SkiaSharp\n\n2.88.8 (Deprecated)\n\n### IDE / Editor\n\nVisual Studio (Windows)\n\n### Platform / Operating System\n\nAndroid\n\n### Platform / Operating System Version\n\nAndroid 15\n\n### Devices\n\nPixel 7 emulator.\n\n### Relevant Screenshots\n\nMap Auto-Center should have a circle around the relevant button and a line connecting the circle to the red text box.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/268c04b4-f4ac-44b7-afa9-7cae53414715)\n\n### Relevant Log Output\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060shell\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project\u0027s Code of Conduct",
