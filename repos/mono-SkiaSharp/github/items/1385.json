You must make sure to check out the correct tag for the version you are using.\n\nHowever, if you are not restricted, you can check out the brand new builds that will soon be released: https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/pull/1382\n\nThis makes use of the new v2 preview packages which are available in the preview feed right now. It will not work with the older v1 versions. The exact package version to use is in the description.\n\nYou can also talk to \u0022jmacato\u0022 in https://gitter.im/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia  as he confirmed the packages are working. ",
