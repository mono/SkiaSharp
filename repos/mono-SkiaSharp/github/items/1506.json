  "body": "WPF under Windows 10.\r\n\r\nI have this layout\r\n\r\nWindow -\u003E WrapPanel -\u003E UserControl -\u003E SKElement.\r\n\r\nWith this hiearchy, the PaintSurface event attached to the SKElement never gets called.\r\n\r\nIf I pull the SKElement \u0022one level up\u0022 (i.e. get rid of the WrapPanel)\r\nWindow -\u003E UserControl -\u003E SKElement\r\n\r\nThe PaintSurface event is called again.\r\nI expected it to work, instead it is never called. Calling InvalidateVisual on the SKElement does not help either: when outside the panel it triggers a call to PaintSurface, when inside a panel it does nothing.\r\n",
