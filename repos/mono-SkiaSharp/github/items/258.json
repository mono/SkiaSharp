If so, to what extent?\r\n\r\nI already asked this question a little over a year ago here: #21 \r\nBack then the answer was no, but now I noticed there is a SkiaSharp.Svg NuGet package. \r\n\r\nFrom looking at the source it appears to be rather basic support of SVG (?), are there plans to fully support the SVG spec?",

        "body": "We do want to support SVG, but this is no small task. SVG has a HUGE scope and detailed specification: http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/\r\n\r\nAt this point, SkiaSharp is more of wrapper for skia, with some added features. We will probably only support SVG in the same way skia does, when they do. This is not to say that someone (anyone really) can create a SVG engine that makes use of SkiaSharp as the rendering engine. Essentially, SkiaSharp is a 2D raster graphics engine, thus SVG and any vector system will have to be created from scratch.\r\n\r\nI am looking at creating a SVG engine with inspiration for WebKit\r\nhttps://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/\u002B/master/third_party/WebKit/Source/core/svg/\r\n\r\nBut... That is nowhere near a proof-of-concept even. I would not wait for this. There are a few SVG engines for .NET, but they aren\u0027t really cross-platform or mobile friendly.\r\n\r\nSVG is not a case of we don\u0027t want or we don\u0027t care, but simply a case of the SkiaSharp team is too small to get around to doing this. At this point, the community will have to jump in on this.",

        "body": "I was asking on the skia forums, and it appears SVG work is underway, but not coming any time soon. This is because SVG support is really not a big requirement of either Chrome or Android.\r\n\r\nThey have right now a limited support:\r\nhttps://github.com/google/skia/blob/2979b1a7eaffcdcf994e506caf743a9adf35b8ed/experimental/svg/model/SkSVGDOM.cpp#L279-L330\r\n\r\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/skia-discuss/EuU-KljkQoE\r\n\u003E ... we are still working toward an SVG backend for Skia.\u00A0 Practically speaking development is active, but we don\u0027t have exact time frame and the extent of support (have you seen the spec!?) is a bit unclear at this point.\u00A0 As you mention, our biggest clients don\u0027t really need this support, but a handful of others have expressed interest, so it\u0027s something we\u0027re doing as possible to expand capability of the library.\r\n\r\nI think it is safe to say that it is coming, eventually. I will endeavor to contribute to skia to get a fuller SVG support, but I can make no promises on this point. I think both skia and SkiaSharp have the same points in that SVG is large and not easy to implement. But, there are many low-hanging fruit that can be done to aid this process - for example, there is no radial gradient support yet, so that could be added, without too much work.",
