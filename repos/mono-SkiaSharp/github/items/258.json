If so, to what extent?\r\n\r\nI already asked this question a little over a year ago here: #21 \r\nBack then the answer was no, but now I noticed there is a SkiaSharp.Svg NuGet package. \r\n\r\nFrom looking at the source it appears to be rather basic support of SVG (?), are there plans to fully support the SVG spec?",
