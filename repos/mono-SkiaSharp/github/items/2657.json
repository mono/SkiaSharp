        "body": "Found out this is due to the fact that computed shaders will just not work in skiasharp v2 with non-hardware accelerated views. The closest looking resolution could be the (soon?) release of skiasharp v3 where shaders could also use cpu, or less \u0022soon-looking\u0022 gpu support on windows implementation. Basically let\u0027s way for skiasharp 3.0 which is actually in closed prerelease state.",
