Rebuilding and then I\u0027ll let you know when you can get your hands on the build.\r\n\r\nI did start a build on our public CI:\r\nhttps://dev.azure.com/xamarin/public/_build/results?buildId=11744\u0026view=results\r\n\r\nThat should work for testing, but I am also going to push out the PR build to the preview feed:\r\n\r\n\u003E https://aka.ms/skiasharp-eap/index.json\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is that CI builds both the preview and the stable packages to make sure everything is working. Then when I release I first push the preview packages for a few weeks, and then go stable - no need to rebuild. But, sometimes you may be tempted to select the stable packages from the CI server - and then it gets cached... I can control what gets to the preview feed.",
