        "body": "Thanks for this issue. I am looking at this now. Not quite sure exactly what is going on, but I think that your observation of the change in v1.56.1 and 1.56.2 helps out a great deal. I was thinking the Google changed something, but it now appears that there may be some issue with the way in which the SVG is drawn.\r\n\r\nClosing this one as I believe it is a duplicate of #284  If you want to follow the progress, you can just watch that issue.",
