  "body": "Hi, we\u0027re recently picked up a package (LiveCharts) that includes binaries from SkiaSharp. We have some automation that verifies that all of the binary files we ship have valid file version resources, but these two binaries don\u0027t have it.\r\n\r\nlibHarfBuzzSharp.dll\r\nlibSkiaSharp.dll\r\n\r\nIs it possible to have file version resources added for all binaries for serviceability purposes?\r\nThanks!",
