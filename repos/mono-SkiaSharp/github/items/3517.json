  "title": "bug-repro skill: require evidence for version blockers",
  "body": "## Summary\n\nAdds mandatory version feasibility verification to the bug-repro skill, preventing premature bail-outs based on assumptions.\n\n## Motivation\n\nDuring reproduction of #2759, the agent wrote *\u0022SkiaSharp 1.60.1 is too old to test with .NET 8\u0022* as a blocker **without actually checking**. A 10-second nupkg inspection revealed:\n- Managed assembly targets \u0060netstandard1.3\u0060 (fully compatible with .NET 8)\n- Native binaries use standard \u0060runtimes/osx/native/\u0060 layout\n- Only real issue: no arm64 native binary (solvable via Rosetta)\n\nThe skill already said \u0022push hard, don\u0027t bail early\u0022 \u2014 the agent ignored it because it lacked a concrete verification step.\n\n## Changes (31 lines, 2 files)\n\n### SKILL.md\n1. **Phase 2 step 2b** \u2014 Mandatory \u0060nupkg\u0060 feasibility check before writing version blockers. Includes copy-paste \u0060curl\u0060/\u0060unzip\u0060 command, TFM compatibility rules, and Rosetta workaround.\n2. **Anti-pattern #8** \u2014 \u0022Pre-emptive version assumptions\u0022: never assume incompatibility without inspecting the nupkg.\n\n### conclusion-guide.md\n3. **Blocker evidence requirements table** \u2014 Version/compatibility blockers must cite concrete evidence (nupkg listing or actual error).\n\n## Review process\n\nPlan was reviewed by 5 models (GPT-5.2, Opus 4.5, Gemini 3 Pro, Haiku 4.5, GPT-5). All agreed:\n- Original 4-file plan was over-scoped \u2192 reduced to 3 edits in 2 files\n- Dropped new \u0060repro-strategies.md\u0060 section (version regression isn\u0027t a bug category)\n- Concrete commands beat conceptual guidance\n- Blockers need evidence \u2014 this is the structural fix",
