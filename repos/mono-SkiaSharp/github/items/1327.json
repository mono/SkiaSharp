  "title": "[QUESTION] How to add and deploy (lib)SkiaSharp to WPF .NET Framework project",
  "body": "Hi SkiaSharp team,\r\n\r\nI have the following situation/problem.\r\nWe are trying to deploy a standalone Windows WPF desktop application based on .NET Framework 4.7.2. Which has a (indirect) dependency on SkiaSharp (developed in Visual Studio 2019). \r\nWe have added/installed SkiaSharp using NuGet.\r\n\r\nWhen we\u0027re deploying (using ClickOnce) the libSkiaSharp.dll is not being \u0022published\u0022 nor is it added to the application manifest file.\r\n\r\nWe\u0027ve tried deploying the application in many configuration including setting specific PlatformTarget settings, such as x86 and x64, both on the project as well as on the solution (as mentioned in many threads and issue reports). But non of the settings result in having the libSkiaSharp.dll in the deployment folder (default ClickOnce target being \u0022app.publish\u0022) or being mentioned in the manifest file.\r\n\r\nDuring development everything works fine since the libSkiaSharp.dll does exist in the \u0022bin/Debug\u0022 (also in the \u0022bin/Release\u0022) folder and no manifest file is used.\r\n\r\nHow do we properly add/setup SkiaSharp to a project in such a way that we can deploy our project with a native (Windows) ShiaSharp library (preferably using ClickOnce)?\r\n\r\nThank you for your help",
