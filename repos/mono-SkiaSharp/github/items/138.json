  "title": "Add GPU Feature Support",
  "body": "This is going to be the root issue where we discuss how and what we put forward to get the GPU / hardware accelerated drawing in place. Our aim is to make sure everything that needs to be is here, but not adding too much more just because we can. \n\nThe idea behind SkiaSharp is to make sure that we wrap the C\u002B\u002B as nicely as we can, but not create a new engine. If we add lots of code, when Google makes a change, we will then have to go and update all that code. SkiaSharp is supposed to be thin. We can always create a set of extension APIs or packages that make everything awesome.\n\nFirst things first, we are working in the [gpu-support](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/tree/gpu-support) branch for the C#/managed section and the [gpu-support](https://github.com/mono/skia/tree/gpu-support) branch for the native C\u002B\u002B Skia.\n\nYou can view the [managed diff](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/compare/gpu-support) and the [native diff](https://github.com/mono/skia/compare/xamarin-mobile-bindings...mono:gpu-support).\n\nIf you think we need an API, just leave a comment and we can make sure that we add it. If you created another issue already, just add a link so we can have everything in one place. If your feature is too big for normal support, just create another issue and leave a comment. It doesn\u0027t matter what you do, we will make sure that everything gets organized for you!\n",
