  "title": "[QUESTION] Build on FreeBSD",
  "body": "Hi guys, I\u0027m trying to build libSkiaSharp for FreeBSD, but I hit a roadblock. Had to modify a check in the DNG SDK to make it build, but I\u0027m getting strange errors when the static archives are linked:\r\n\r\n\u0060ar: warning: can\u0027t open file: @libzlib_x86.a.rsp: No such file or directory\u0060\r\n\r\nThe end result is unusable as the archive is basically empty, I\u0027m guessing there\u0027s an issue with BSD\u0027s \u0060ar\u0060. I have yet to try \u0060llvm-ar\u0060, but if you have any pointers that would be great.",
