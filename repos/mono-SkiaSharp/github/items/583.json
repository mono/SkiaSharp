  "body": "I\u0027d like to build a skia sharp library file (dynamic/shared) that will only be used for Font rendering, thus reducing the size of my program\u0027s dependencies. However, I am unable to find a way to configure Skia Sharp to only include certain parts of it and would like to know if there is any guide I can follow for this.",

        "body": "SkiaSharp is already quite small, usually between 4-5 MB per platform architecture. The last few releases was actually a bug, see #573 and #584 \r\n\r\nTo further reduce the size, you could have a look at building your own. We typically include everything because we don\u0027t know what you are going to be using. You can remove quite a bit.\r\n\r\nIt is relatively simple to build your own: https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/blob/v1.60.2/cake/BuildExternals.cake#L532-L559\r\n\r\nIn most cases, it is just a case of running \u0060gn\u0060 to generate the build files - here you pass along all the bits that you want. and then either run \u0060ninja\u0060 or \u0060ndk-build\u0060. In fact, this is how most people build for Linux: https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/wiki/Building-on-Linux#building",
