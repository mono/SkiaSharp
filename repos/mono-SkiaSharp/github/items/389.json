        "body": "@entdark that only really saves the matrix and clipping.\r\n\r\n@Packiaseelan I don\u0027t think this is something that is supported in the way you may want, but you can do this by drawinf to a secondary canvas (such as one from a \u0060SKPictureRecorder\u0060). This will allow you to choose whether or not to draw the image to the main screen.\r\n\r\nI don\u0027t believe there is a way undo/redo commands, but you can ask on the google forums: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/skia-discuss",
