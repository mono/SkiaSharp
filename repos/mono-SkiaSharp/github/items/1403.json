  "body": "For testing, I often build just a single external, e.g. Windows.\r\n\r\nInstead of listing all externals that should be skipped, it would be handy to specify just the externals to build.\r\n\r\nE.g. in the \u0060externals.cake\u0060:\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060CS\r\n    if (JUST_EXTERNALS.Length \u003E 0)\r\n        return JUST_EXTERNALS.Contains(platform);\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\nOn could then build with \r\n\r\n\u0060./bootstrapper.ps1 --target=libs --justExternals=windows\u0060\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
