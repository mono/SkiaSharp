If you still aren\u0027t sure about where to ask your question, then go ahead and ask here! We will try and answer you, but if we can\u0027t, then we will help you get the answers you want.\r\n\r\n--\u003E Hi Friends,\r\n\r\nI am using SKXamlCanvas into my current project but It has some performance issue. When I add lots of graphical shapes to canvas, zooming and panning started getting extremely slow so, I looked around and found out that the SKSwapChainPanel uses OpenGL which could solve my problem. As of now, SKSwapChainPanel is only available in UWP so, I decided to port it to WinUI3 my self. I downloaded latest code and removed comments from **AngleSwapChainPanel.cs \u0026 SKSwapChainPanel.cs**. I am able to compile/build fine but as soon as I add generated **SkiaSharp.dll \u0026 SkiaSharp.Views.Windows.dll** files to my Test project, I get following exception (see attached image below). I tried to clean rebuild many times without any luck. I also tried to compiled with x64 both projects as well.\r\n\r\nI am using Visual Studio 2022, MSIX 1.0.\r\n\r\nCan somebody please let me know what I am missing here? Please let me know if you want me to upload my project solutions here.\r\n\r\nThanks In Advance,\r\nAmit Parmar\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19598410/147265444-eb65be5a-6d5e-48ec-8cb1-455e23e34394.png)\r\n\r\n",
