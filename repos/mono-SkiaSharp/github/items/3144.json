        "body": "Hi @danies8 \nI have updated the public item logged on your behalf in the Telerik MAUI feedback portal. https://feedback.telerik.com/maui/1676817-warning-maccatalyst-not-linking-with-the-framework-opengles-referenced-by-a-module-reference-in-skiasharp-views-ios-dll \n\nIn general, the issue happens with Skia 2.88.6/7/8 versions. With Telerik MAUI 11.0.0 release, we have updated the SkiaSharp version we use as a dependency to version 3.116.1. So now the warning message is not presented. You can update the Telerik MAUI version to 11.0.0 and test on your side.",
