        "body": "I\u0027m also seeing this recently. I\u0027m using .Net 8 with SkiaSharp, SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.WebAssembly, SkiaSharp.Views.Blazor version 3.119.0. I have several build environments and it is not consistently occurring on all of them, but has occurred at one time or another on all of them. Additionally, when I have a build environment where I don\u0027t see this exception, if I publish my blazor web application and run it on a platform where I am seeing the exception, I can run the published version without the exception. All of the build environments are using the same source code from the same git repo and running the same version of VS 2022.\n\nI started seeing the issue late last week, but I cannot pin it down to any particular upgrade.\n\nI\u0027m also unable to debug using the c# web assembly debugger (shift-alt-d) due to this issue: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/61559 \n\nI also attempted adding the construction of a new SKImageInfo in the OnAfterRenderAsync method but this did not cause the exception.\n\nThe exception I see in the browser console:\nmarshal-to-js.ts:349  Uncaught ManagedError: The type initializer for \u0027SkiaSharp.SKImageInfo\u0027 threw an exception.\n    at Jn (marshal-to-js.ts:349:18)\n    at kr (invoke-cs.ts:277:19)\n    at l.javaScriptExports.call_delegate (managed-exports.ts:171:13)\n    at SKHtmlCanvas.i [as renderFrameCallback] (marshal-to-js.ts:197:53)\n    at SKHtmlCanvas.ts:161:10",
