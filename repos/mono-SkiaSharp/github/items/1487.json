I have no problem just wondering the reason.\r\n\r\nThis is for two reasons. The first is because the array needs to be memset to zero, and the second is looping in managed code can be quite slow with the interpreter, even when using pointers. Pinning the managed array and providing it to Skia is very fast.\r\n\r\nAlso the build is failing, but I cannot see the errors. What are they ?",
