  "title": "Add .Net Core support (.Net Standard target)",
  "body": "Would be nice to port this package to .Net Standard so it could be reusable across .Net Framework, .Net Core and Mono. I guess the main difficulty here is to deal with native libraries for so many platforms (do all .Net core targets have to be supported ?). Any thoughts on this ?\n",
