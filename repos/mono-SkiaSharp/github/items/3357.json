  "body": "### Description\n\nCan you help migrate my docs from the docs folder into the c# source.\n\n* There is a guide here: ~/API.Docs.Migration.Guide.md\n* This is the checklist of APIs to migrate: ~/API.Docs.Migration.Checklist.md\n\nPlease go through each item on the checklist and migrate.\n\n### Setup\n\nMake sure that BEFORE you start, checkout all submodules. Don\u0027t try build anything or run any tests. The agents are not set up to do this.\n\n### Migration\n\nJust go through the checklist and migrate each type.\n\nThere is one important thing. Each type should be migrated and commited separately. We have a team that looks at things by commit and they do not want to have multiple types being done in a single commit.\n\nMigrate all the members in the types.\n\n### Rules\n\n* Migrate one type at a time\n* Migrate all the mebers on the type, even if there are many\n* Commit the changes for each type\n* Do not skip a type or member\n\n\n",
