  "title": "QUESTION: Is it possible to create PDF having Svg Images in xamarin.forms?",
  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nQuick question; i made my search but i couldnt find any good information or search. I am using other paid library to create pdf but it doesnt support svg images in pdf. I see that there is svg support available in skiasharp. I wonder if it is possible to create pdf with svg image in .net standard library directly or i should go into native libraries with dependency injection. is there any good example for it please?\r\n\r\nThanks",

        "body": "Technically yes, but not as an independent image because SkiaSharp creates PDFs as if it was a drawing canvas. So, if you want to have an SVG in a pacge, you have to draw the image as if it was any other image - maybe using the SkiaSharp.Extended.Svg package.\r\n\r\nWhen drawing, there is no distinction between the raster/GPU/PDF canvases for the drawing code - just the surface creation.\r\n\r\nFor example, here is the sample to create a PDF: https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/blob/master/samples/Gallery/Shared/Samples/CreatePdfSample.cs#L47\r\n\r\nIt uses the exact same drawing code as if it was a surface. The only diference is that the canvas comes from a SKDocument instad of a SKSurface.\r\n",
