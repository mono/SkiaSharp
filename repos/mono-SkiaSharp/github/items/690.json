  "title": "QUESTION: Is it possible to create PDF having Svg Images in xamarin.forms?",
  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nQuick question; i made my search but i couldnt find any good information or search. I am using other paid library to create pdf but it doesnt support svg images in pdf. I see that there is svg support available in skiasharp. I wonder if it is possible to create pdf with svg image in .net standard library directly or i should go into native libraries with dependency injection. is there any good example for it please?\r\n\r\nThanks",
