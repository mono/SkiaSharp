  "body": "I have a Lumia 820 that has Windows 10 build 15031. The code that works well on a Lumia 950XL does not draw anything on the hacked phone. I realize that this is a non-issue but it still would be nice if I could use my old phone as a low-end developer device. Is there anything that can be done in SkiaSharp?\r\n\r\nCanvas size and other stuff look normal in debugger, SKCanvasView works just fine.",
