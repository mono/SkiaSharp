It is still a bit rough, (stable) Xamarin.Forms does not yet nicely support .NET Standard, so I had to add: \u0060\u003CPackageTargetFallback\u003Eportable-net45\u002Bwin8\u002Bwpa81\u002Bwp8\u003C/PackageTargetFallback\u003E\u0060 to the .csproj. Not too bad, but hopefully as soon as 2.4 goes stable, we can remove it.\r\n\r\nAlso, UWP is still a bit annoying, it doesn\u0027t support a pure .csproj format. I moved the package references into the project file, but I still have to keep that project.json around. All the other projects use the new packages format.",
