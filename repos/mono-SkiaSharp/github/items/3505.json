  "title": "Fix stable version handling in release skills",
  "body": "Update all 3 release skills to correctly document stable version numbering.\n\n**Problem:** The release skills assumed all NuGet versions include a build number suffix. For stable releases, the NuGet version is just the base (e.g., \u00603.119.2\u0060) \u2014 the build number only appears in the internal feed\u0027s prerelease tag (\u00603.119.2-stable.3\u0060).\n\n**Changes:**\n- **release-testing:** Split version resolution (Step 2) into preview vs stable paths; added stable examples for CI version extraction and user reporting\n- **release-publish:** Added NuGet version row to Preview vs Stable differences table; split version confirmation into preview vs stable formats with separate verification commands\n- **release-branch:** Added NuGet version format note after the release type table",
