  "title": "Support for SkColor HSV \u003C-\u003E RGB",
  "body": "It\u0027d be great to wrap these Skia functions from SkColor: \u0060SkRGBToHSV\u0060 and \u0060SkHSVToColor\u0060.\n\nI\u0027ve already started work on this, but I figured there should be an issue open so that it can be discussed. One problem I\u0027m having already (it would be great if someone can chime in) is how to add a new file \u0060sk_color.{cpp,h}\u0060 to the Skia C API. I\u0027ve modified the \u0060core.gypi\u0060 file to include it, and it is compiling, but doesn\u0027t seem to be linking it into \u0060libskia_windows.dll\u0060.\n",
