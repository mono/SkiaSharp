  "body": "## Summary\n\nFixes an issue where the release-testing skill could incorrectly report \u0022packages not found\u0022 when the EAP feed contains multiple version streams.\n\n## Problem\n\nWhen monitoring for release packages, the agent was using \u0060.latestVersion\u0060 from the JSON response, which only returns the newest version across ALL version streams. When a newer stream exists (e.g., 3.119.3-preview.0), the specific version being released (e.g., 3.119.2-preview.3) would never be found.\n\n## Solution\n\n- Updated Step 2 in SKILL.md to use \u0060.version\u0060 with proper filtering by \u0060{base}-{label}.*\u0060\n- Added explicit warning about the \u0060.latestVersion\u0060 trap\n- Added \u0022Package Resolution Errors\u0022 section to troubleshooting.md\n\n## Changes\n\n| File | Change |\n|------|--------|\n| \u0060SKILL.md\u0060 | Updated package resolution to use \u0060.version\u0060 \u002B filtering |\n| \u0060troubleshooting.md\u0060 | Added Package Resolution Errors section |\n\n## Testing\n\nVerified the correct command finds packages:\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\ndotnet package search SkiaSharp \\\n  --source \u0022https://aka.ms/skiasharp-eap/index.json\u0022 \\\n  --exact-match --prerelease --format json \\\n  | jq -r \u0027.searchResult[].packages[] | select(.id == \u0022SkiaSharp\u0022) | .version\u0027 \\\n  | grep \u0022^3.119.2-preview.3\\.\u0022\n# Output: 3.119.2-preview.3.1\n\u0060\u0060\u0060",
