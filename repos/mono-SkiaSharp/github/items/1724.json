        "body": "\u0060Maui.Graphics\u0060 is an abstraction of graphic APIs that support various backends to run on many platforms. For example \u0060CoreGraphics\u0060 on Apple platforms or \u0060SharpDX\u0060 on Windows. In addition to these native backends there is also a \u0060SkiaSharp\u0060 backend on most platforms. So the idea is to have one API which you use to write your rendering code and run it on a variety of platforms either backed by \u0060SkiaSharp\u0060 or the built-in engine of the platform.\r\n\r\nHere you can find an overview of the abstractions\r\n[https://github.com/dotnet/Microsoft.Maui.Graphics#supported-platforms](https://github.com/dotnet/Microsoft.Maui.Graphics#supported-platforms)",
