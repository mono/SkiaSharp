        "body": "@juepiezhongren It is easy to create these. Just take a dependency on SkiaSharp or on SkiaSharp.Forms (the latter supporting touch), make a control, and release it. https://github.com/verybadcat/CSharpMath controls are doing it this way.\r\n\r\nThis does not need input from Xamarin. And I don\u0027t think you can implement controls this way in the Xamarin.Forms repo without more discussion as XF would need to take a SkiaSharp dependency.",
