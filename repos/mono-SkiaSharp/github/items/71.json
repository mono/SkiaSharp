  "title": "React to user input",
  "body": "I am not sure if this is meant to be part of SkiaSharp, but I was searching through the docs about a way to actually react to user input such as touch gestures.\nReason being, I would like to convert my android drawing app to use shiasharp instead of the drawing canvas api in order to make it kinda platform independant.\n\nAre there any plans to introduce such features at any time? Or are they already there and I missed them?\n\nSorry for not asking in stackoverflow - I was not sure if you guys would read it there...\n\nThank you so much for clarifying things!\n",
