  "title": "Pan and Pinch gestures bad performance in Forms UWP",
  "body": "Hi!\r\nI tested Pich and Pan gestures from sample project in Forms/UWP app and it\u0027s slow. When dragging image from BitmapScale sample it doesn\u0027t move smoothly, especially when drag distance is large. In OpenGL backed gestures don\u0027t work at all. Tested on Lumia 950 (not XL), SkiaSharp 1.56-2 (latest from nuget, I had to downgrade from 1.57 used in sample project).\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nMarcin",
