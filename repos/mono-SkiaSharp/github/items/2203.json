  "title": "[QUESTION] Draw surface to a canvas region?",
  "body": "As stated in the title, I would like to draw the content of one surface to another surface canvas region.\r\n\r\nI already found the Surface.Draw() method, which allows me to specify a SKCanvas to draw to.\r\nThe method also requires a [x] and [y] parameter to specify \u0022where\u0022 to draw to, but no [width] and [height].\r\n\r\nSo long story short, how do I \u0022scale\u0022 while drawing my surface to another canvas?\r\n\r\nAlso, is there a way to specify a source region? So I can specify what region of my surface I want to draw to another canvas.",
