        "body": "Hi @EAxp3, thanks for giving SkiaSharp a go.\n\nYou might be having a problem because you are using the not-yet-complete on the master branch. As we add more features, we do it on the master branch - sometimes things are broken or rely on code that is not yet finalized. I would suggest downloading the samples from a \u0022release\u0022. The latest is the v1.54.1 release: https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/releases/tag/v1.54.1\n\nYou can download the repo there using the \u0022Source code (zip)\u0022 link. this will also give you a much smaller download as it doesn\u0027t include the very large external dependencies.\n\nOnce downloaded, the samples will download all the correct NuGet packages and you problems should go away.\n",
