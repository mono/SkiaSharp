  "body": "At the moment it\u0027s not possible to disable automatic resizing of the canvas. Besides that there is a bug in the automatic resizing, I don\u0027t want the functionality at all for my project.\r\n\r\nWould it be a good idea to add a parameter \u0027IgnoreResizing\u0027 / \u0027DisableAutomaticResizing\u0027 to the canvas? Setting the value to \u0027true\u0027 will not load the SizeWatcher JavasScript at all: https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/blob/3c721d250969ba6d0617827a3aa1d4f15fe95747/source/SkiaSharp.Views.Blazor/SkiaSharp.Views.Blazor/SKCanvasView.razor.cs#L70\r\n\r\nI could add the functionality if you are open for it? Thanks in advance!\r\n",

        "body": "\u003E why would you want to disable automatic resizing?\r\n\r\nBecause sometimes you have the requirement of a fixed width and height for the canvas. I stumpled upon this issue searching for options on how to set width and height to a specific value but did not find any. Then I had a look at the source code just to see that JSInterop is overriding my initially set width and height settings. So, I am in the same boat as @Code-Chops requiring the auto size thing to be controllable.",
