The docs still list it: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/skiasharp.skcolorfilter.createcolorcube?view=skiasharp-1.57.1. Probably might have been removed from Skia itself but how come? Are we supposed to go backwards? :-(",

It is unused.\u0060 commit.\r\n\r\nThe best thing i can suggest is ask on the Google forums: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/skia-discuss They may know what the best replacement - or maybe a better way to do what you want.",
