  "title": "Trouble getting the SKWidget to appear in the GUI Designer in MonoDevelop (on Linux)",
  "body": "I added the packages \u0060SkiaSharp\u0060 and \u0060SkiaSharp.Views\u0060 to my project.  In the GUI designer, I didn\u0027t see the \u0060SKWidget\u0060 appear in the \u0060Toolbox\u0060.  I have other projects in my solution that have custom widgets and they appear in there.\r\n\r\nI tried adding the \u0060SkaiSharp.Views.Gtk\u0060 DLL (from the solution\u0027s \u0060packages/\u0060 folder) using that little \u0022green plus button\u0022 and got a \u0060SKWidget\u0060 to appear under the \u0060General\u0060 section in the toolbox.  But when trying to drag the widget into my GUI, I got an error message saying \u0022The widget \u0027SkiaSharp.Views.Gtk.SKWidget\u0027 could not be found.\u0022\r\n\r\nWhat wrong and how can I fix this?  I\u0027d really like to use Skia for my custom widget drawing.",
