  "title": "[BUG] Please add overload for \u0022SKPath.AddPoly(points, count, isClosed)\u0022",
  "body": "### Description\n\nCurrently using 2.89 and this overload is missing.  The only one available looks like this:\n\n\tpublic unsafe void AddPoly(SKPoint[] points, bool close = true)\n\nand internally makes this call:\n\n       SkiaApi.sk_path_add_poly(Handle, points2, points.Length, close);\n\nInstead of always setting PointCount = points.Length, we\u0027d like to set this count ourselves.\n\nOtherwise we have to recreate the SKPoint[] array every time the point count changes (which happens frequently).\n\nSKIA supports it, so just asking that SkiaSharp adds this overload.\n\n### Code\n\nWant to change our call:\npath.AddPoly(points, false);\n\nto:\npath.AddPoly(points, pointCount, false);\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAdded support for this overload.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThis method is missing.\n\n### Version of SkiaSharp\n\n2.88.9 (Previous)\n\n### Last Known Good Version of SkiaSharp\n\n1.x (Obsolete)\n\n### IDE / Editor\n\nVisual Studio (Windows)\n\n### Platform / Operating System\n\nAndroid, All\n\n### Platform / Operating System Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Devices\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant Log Output\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060shell\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project\u0027s Code of Conduct",
