  "title": "Canvas Info shows huge size when using Chrome Debugger and using Device Emulation",
  "body": "### Description\n\nCreating a simple app in Blazor that renders the clock-example works great, however, when I run device emulation (any device), it alters the size of the the Viewport, and when I attempt to calculate positioning, from e.Info.Size, it shows as a massive size.  \r\n\r\nWhen I first start the test app, without emulation, the width is 300 and the height is 150... but when press \u003CF12\u003E and go into developer tools, and try any of the built-in device emulators, the result is as per screen shot below with massive dimensions.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/assets/1290937/34baab14-c697-4a99-bb9a-2a5d82bd967d)\r\n\r\nThat same appears to be true when I attempt to view the same page on any mobile device. It seems to exhibit the same behavior. \r\n\n\n### Code\n\nThe best way to share code for larger projects is a link to a GitHub repository: https://github.com/user/repo/tree/bug-123\r\n\r\nBut, you can also share a short block of code here:\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060cs\r\n// some C# code here\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\nYou can also share some XAML:\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060xaml\r\n\u003C!-- xaml code here --\u003E\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Version of SkiaSharp\n\n2.88.3 (Current)\n\n### Last Known Good Version of SkiaSharp\n\n2.88.2 (Previous)\n\n### IDE / Editor\n\nVisual Studio (Windows)\n\n### Platform / Operating System\n\nWindows\n\n### Platform / Operating System Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Devices\n\nAndriod, Windows, IOS\n\n### Relevant Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant Log Output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project\u0027s Code of Conduct",
