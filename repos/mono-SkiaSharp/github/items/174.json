        "body": "@kentcb Sometime real soon, like when CI finishes. :) Well actually, it is going to take 2 hours, but I need to sleep (for 6 hours). So, if all goes well, I\u0027ll wake up to a green build and then release.\r\n\r\nIt is going to be marked beta, but this is just because I want to make sure that the changes to the packaging for .net core and .net standard didn\u0027t break anyone (it shouldn\u0027t) and the the stricter linking for smaller sizes didn\u0027t exclude anything (it shouldn\u0027t have). If no-one complains in a day or so, I\u0027ll release stable - this\u0027ll also give me time to finish up the API docs for intellisense and all that.\r\n\r\nHere are some of the big and cool things from the release notes:\r\n\u003E  - Support for **.NET Standard 1.3** project types\r\n\u003E  - Support for **.NET Core** (win7, win10, osx)\r\n\u003E  - Reduced native library sizes to **~5MB** per platform architecture (#174)\r\n\u003E  - _Partial work to get a .NET Core Linux build._ (#90)",
