  "body": "### Description\n\nWith PR [3463](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/pull/3463), SkiaSharp team removed the \u201C**_libmicrohttpd_**\u201D dependency from Skia, as it was previously used only by the **skiaserve** tool.\n\nHowever, it still appears in the [External-Dependency-Info.txt](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/blob/release/3.119.3-preview.1/External-Dependency-Info.txt#L1475) of latest preview release (3.119.3-preview.1).\n\nCould you please remove this entry if it was added by mistake? Otherwise, kindly let us know the reason for still keeping it listed under [External-Dependency-Info.txt](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/blob/release/3.119.3-preview.1/External-Dependency-Info.txt#L1475).\n\n### Code\n\nOld Dependency List -\u003E\nhttps://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/blob/release/3.119.3-preview.1/External-Dependency-Info.txt#L1475\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n**libmicrohttpd** must be removed from the [External-Dependency-Info.txt](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/blob/release/3.119.3-preview.1/External-Dependency-Info.txt#L1475) file as it\u0027s removed recently.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nIt\u0027s removed from the Skia repo but still added in  [External-Dependency-Info.txt](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/blob/release/3.119.3-preview.1/External-Dependency-Info.txt#L1475) file\n\n### Version of SkiaSharp\n\n3.116.0 (Current)\n\n### Last Known Good Version of SkiaSharp\n\n2.88.9 (Previous)\n\n### IDE / Editor\n\nVisual Studio (Windows)\n\n### Platform / Operating System\n\nAll\n\n### Platform / Operating System Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Devices\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant Screenshots\n\n\u003Cimg width=\u0022690\u0022 height=\u0022757\u0022 alt=\u0022Image\u0022 src=\u0022https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6816f7fd-e4e8-463c-a326-055032874ece\u0022 /\u003E\n\n### Relevant Log Output\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060shell\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project\u0027s Code of Conduct",
