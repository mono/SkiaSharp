After porting one of our legacy Win32 apps to use SkiaSharp, out of a sample of 1 million installations around 0.1% are crashing because their systems don\u0027t have DX12, alll mostly on Windows 10.\n\n### Code\n\nThis should be a runtime dependency that is dynamically loaded.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nSkiaSharp loads the necessary DX12 libraries at runtime\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nIt has a link time dependency which causes crashes on systems which aren\u0027t fully updated. \n\n### Version of SkiaSharp\n\n3.116.0 (Current)\n\n### Last Known Good Version of SkiaSharp\n\n2.88.9 (Previous)\n\n### IDE / Editor\n\nVisual Studio (Windows), Visual Studio Code (Windows)\n\n### Platform / Operating System\n\nWindows\n\n### Platform / Operating System Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Devices\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant Log Output\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060shell\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project\u0027s Code of Conduct",
