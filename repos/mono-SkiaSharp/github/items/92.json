Hoping it will perform much better than the custom view drawing that I am using at the moment.\nBecause of the way my projects are structured, it would be helpful if the SkiaSharp assemblies delivered via NuGet were strongly named.\nI can help/offer advice if you need any.\n",

Also, other signed libraries can depend on this.\n\nIf we are to sign, what key should we use? The mono key, or should we just create a new key?\n",
