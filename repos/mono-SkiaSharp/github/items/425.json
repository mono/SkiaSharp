The following sample code results in SKCodecOrigin.TopLeft, which is incorrect.\r\n\r\n        private static SKBitmap Decode(string path, out SKCodecOrigin origin)\r\n        {\r\n            using (var stream = new SKFileStream(path))\r\n            {\r\n                using (var codec = SKCodec.Create(stream))\r\n                {\r\n                    // create the bitmap\r\n                    var bitmap = new SKBitmap(codec.Info.Width, codec.Info.Height);\r\n\r\n                    origin = codec.Origin;\r\n\r\n                    return bitmap;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\nIs this supported for dng files? The chrome browser is able to auto-orient them as expected.\n\n\u003E VS bug [#736302](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/736302)",
