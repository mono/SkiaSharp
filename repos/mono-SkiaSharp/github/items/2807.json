  "title": "[BUG] SKXamlCanvas PointerwheelChanged not respecting DPI?",
  "body": "### Description\n\nI\u0027m not quite exactly sure what happens here. But I have an Uno-App that has a SKXamlCanvas filling nearly the whole screen. On my desktop, it works as expected. But running the app on a Surface device (with presumably different screen-size/DPI/whatever) the PointerWheelChanged-Event only gets invoked when the mouse pointer is in the top left corner of the Canvas. It feels like it is only nearly respecting half of the screen size.\r\n\r\nThe content rendered uses the whole screen, though, and other events like PointerDown get invoked correctly above every part of the canvas.\r\n\r\nI\u0027m using SkiaSharp.View.WinUI and SkiaSharp.Views.Uno.WinUI both in version 2.88.7.\n\n### Code\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\u003Csk:SKXamlCanvas\r\n    x:Name=\u0022swapChain\u0022\r\n    PaintSurface=\u0022OnPaintSwapChain\u0022\r\n    PointerPressed=\u0022OnSurfacePointerPressed\u0022\r\n    PointerMoved=\u0022OnSurfacePointerMoved\u0022\r\n    PointerReleased=\u0022OnSurfacePointerReleased\u0022\r\n    PointerWheelChanged=\u0022OnSurfacePointerWheelChanged\u0022\r\n    PointerExited=\u0022OnPointerExited\u0022\r\n    DoubleTapped=\u0022OnSurfaceDoubleTapped\u0022\r\n    RightTapped=\u0022OnRightTapped\u0022\r\n    Background=\u0022Transparent\u0022/\u003E\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe PointerWheelChanged-event gets raised in every location.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Version of SkiaSharp\n\nOther (Please indicate in the description)\n\n### Last Known Good Version of SkiaSharp\n\nOther (Please indicate in the description)\n\n### IDE / Editor\n\nVisual Studio (Windows)\n\n### Platform / Operating System\n\nWindows\n\n### Platform / Operating System Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Devices\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant Log Output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project\u0027s Code of Conduct",
