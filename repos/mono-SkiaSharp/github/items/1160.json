  "title": "[FEATURE] AspectFill and AspectFit: extra arguments for alignment? ",
  "body": "Currently the \u0060SKRect.AspectFill\u0060 and \u0060SKRect.AspectFit\u0060 methods always center the resulting rectangle in \u0060this\u0060 rectangle.\r\n\r\nIt feel more flexible to me to add two extra arguments to these methods, with default values \u00600.5f\u0060, that describe the alignment of the resulting rectangle in the \u0060this\u0060 rectangle? 0 means align to left or top,  1 means align to right or bottom, all values in between shift proportionally.\r\n\r\nIf this is not acceptable, I would propose to enhance the documentation? It currently doesn\u0027t mention the centering behavior.\r\n\r\nA more orthogonal API approach would be to add \u0060SKRect.Align\u0060 methods that align a rectangle in \u0060this\u0060 rectangle, using similar \u00600..1\u0060 alignment arguments?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nPeter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
