  "title": "libSkiaSharp missing when building the WPF Samples project",
  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nSome people may want to try the samples here without having to build SkiaSharp itself to get a showcase of what can be done, but opening the WPF project \r\nSkiaSharp\\samples\\Gallery\\WPF\\SkiaSharpSample\\SkiaSharpSample.csproj\r\nAnd running it results in a runtime exception:\r\nDllNotFoundException: Unable to load DLL \u0027libSkiaSharp\u0027: The specified module could not be found. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x8007007E)\r\n\r\nVC\u002B\u002B Runtime is installed and other apps using SkiaSharp older version build and run correctly\r\n\r\nThe libSkiaSharp dll is not available in the project, so users cannot quickly run the WPF version without downloading Android SDK, etc. to be able to build the whole SkiaSharp project\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nIt will be much easier if WPF project could be built and run without having to build Skia locally (due to additional downloads required) \r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe project fails to build, but can be run afterwards, resulting in runtime exception\r\n",
