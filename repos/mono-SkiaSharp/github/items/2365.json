  "title": "[FEATURE] bindings for SkSG (scene graph) module",
  "body": "I am interested in using Skia\u0027s SkSG (scene graph) module.\r\n\r\nIs there a reason (other than lack of need) SkiaSharp doesn\u0027t have bindings for the scene graph module for anything but the \u0060InvalidatonController\u0060?\r\n\r\nHow would one go about producing bindings for that module?  What are the guidelines on how to map c\u002B\u002B class hierarchies in c#?",

        "body": "Looking into the code of the SkSG.  It isn\u0027t very big, and not that complex.  For a nice API and probably better performance, it is probably better for C# apps to implement their own scene graph.\r\n\r\nI will probably use it as a design reference instead of binding, though I will be happy to work with anybody else interested to make bindings available anyway.  I would like to work through binding a class hierarchy, if only as an exercise.",
