        "body": "In the google fork of libjpeg-turbo, they made an optimization to not duplicate a 65k byte table, however, this was never upstreamed. This means that skia may grow a little bit during the fix of this issue. I will try and see if I can get the optimization added upstream and then update again, but for now we will have to lose a bit.\r\n\r\n - https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/issues/114\r\n",

They may have made some changes, but the author looks to be really break adverse - so it is comforting.\r\n\r\nI\u0027ll get a preview out ASAP for testing - and then a stable release shortly after.",
