        "body": "That, my fine friend is the sheer power of .NET demonstrated! SkiaSharp is about 4-6MB, but if you have enough platforms it reaches that big number.\r\n - Android (x4)\r\n - iOS (x4)\r\n - macOS (x1)\r\n - Windows (x2)\r\n - UWP (x4)\r\n - tvOS (x2)\r\n - watchOS (x2)\r\n - Tizen (x2)\r\n\r\nAnd that is just in the MAIN package - we have additional packages for 2 Linux versions and Nano Server!\r\n\r\nWe build for and support all those platforms.\r\n\r\nThe big package is a bit of a pain, so we are thinking of splitting the package (transparently) in #1073 ",
