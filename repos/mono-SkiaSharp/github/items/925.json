  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have Skia\u0027s OnCanvasViewPaintSurface working with Prism\u0027s EventToCommandBehavior\u0027s but now I want to InvalidateSurface but to do that I need a reference to SKCanvasView. In every example I\u0027ve seen Skia is setup with Forms where you can access the CanvasView by name from the code behind. How do I get the SKCanvasView from a ViewModel?\r\n\r\nThanks",
