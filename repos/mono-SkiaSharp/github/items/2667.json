        "body": "I tested 3.0.1 and the latest main and I think this is an issue in libjpeg-turbo. For now I am reverting to the latest 2.x series.\r\n\r\nI had a look at the original security issue and it does not affect the 2.x series because 12-bit jpegs are not actually supported in our build. The 2.x series required the entire library to be either 8-bit or 12-bit, and we use 8-bit. The 3.x series allowed for both simultaneously.\r\n\r\nThe security issue was just reported for 2.1.90 (which seems like a 2.x series but is actually a 3.0 beta). The current stable version is 2.1.5.1 which is on a separate branch.\r\n\r\nI have opened an issue in libjpeg-turbo where I will try and determine the real cause and where this issue should live: https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/issues/741",
