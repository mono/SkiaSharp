  "body": "**Description**\r\n\r\nI\u0027m migrating an existing Xamarin.Forms drawn control (https://github.com/VictorKochetkov/Xamarin.Forms.CircularProgressBar) to .NET Maui, when I thought the job was done I found that when I run the app through From Visual Studio the control works perfectly but when I run the app directly from the phone a crash occurs and I don\u0027t receive any kind of information to find out what is happening, I can\u0027t debug either since if I run it through Visual Studio it works perfectly I\u0027m a bit lost on that. I have added the:\r\n\u0060.UseSkiaSharp()\u0060\r\n\r\nIn the MauiProgram class, I have also tried using:\r\n\u0060.UseSkiaSharp(true)\u0060\r\n\r\nI have also tried to install these 3 packages at the same time and in all possible combinations:\r\n\r\n- SkiaSharp.Views.Maui.Controls\r\n- SkiaSharp.Views.Maui.Core\r\n- SkiaSharp.Views.Maui.Controls.Compatibility\r\n\r\nBut nothing works, could you help me about it? Any other information you need you can contact me. Thanks.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nThat the application can be run directly from the phone without a crash.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\nCurrently the application runs perfectly through Visual Studio but if you try to run it directly from your phone a crash occurs without detailing any information about what happened.\r\n\r\n**Basic Information**\r\n\r\n- Version with issue:  SkiaSharp.Views.Maui.Controls 2.88.3\r\n- Last known good version:  None.\r\n- IDE:  Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 (64-bit) - Version 17.4.3\r\n  - Android: Android 10\r\n- Target Devices:  \r\n  - Honor View 10\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\nHere you can see the control working perfectly when the application is run through Visual studio:\r\n\r\n![chrome_5sciTGJ3sB](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20904914/208062095-5d6ba295-1c05-47c0-a085-70b0fee4a343.gif)\r\n\r\n**Reproduction Link**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/nacompllo/SKCanvasViewCrash\r\n",
