  "body": "I\u0027m currently struggling to get Skia to interpret escape sequences within a string...\r\n\r\nSKPain.MeasureText() seems to ignore escape sequences entirely. If I include a newline command (\\n), it still measures the text as a single line. (Which is obviously not what I would expect from a text measureing function)\r\n\r\nAnd when I draw a text which contains escape sequences, the sequence gets replaced by an \u0022empty rectangle\u0022 character (No glyph found for that character), instead of hiding it and drawing a second line.\r\n\r\nAm I doing something wrong? Or is there a different way to process text in skia?",
