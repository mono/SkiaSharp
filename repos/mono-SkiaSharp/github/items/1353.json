But, I think it is now time to update that feed with all the versions.\r\n\r\nA fix will be to just make sure that a correct version of Xamarin.Forms is installed.\r\n\r\nAre you using the \u0060SKRuntimeEffect\u0060?",

For normal use, it is better to stick to the \u0060-preview\u0060, \u0060-alpha\u0060, \u0060-beta\u0060 and \u0060-rc\u0060 versions. Use the \u0060-pr.xxxx\u0060 when you actually want the feature/fix in the PR.\r\n\r\nI\u0027ll be pushing the latest versions of all the things soon, so it is likely going to be a \u00602.80.0-preview.17\u0060 or a bit later\r\n",
