  "title": "[QUESTION] Draw rounded rectangle with transparent color that blurres the background ",
  "body": "I like to draw a rounded rectangle that\u0027s white with Alpha set to 20%. Trough the translucent color it should blur the background.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24532065/183426913-e32c0df6-1d99-4360-957e-13a1444964a1.png)\r\n\r\nMy first thought was  just setting a \u0060MaskFilter\u0060 while drawing the rectangle. This just blurred the rectangle and not the background I drawing on.\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060c#\r\nusing var blurredBoxPaint = new SKPaint();\r\nblurredBoxPaint.IsAntialias = true;\r\nblurredBoxPaint.MaskFilter = SKMaskFilter.CreateBlur(SKBlurStyle.Inner, 2);\r\nblurredBoxPaint.Color = SKColors.White.WithAlpha((int) (.2 * 255));\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\nMy second thought was cropping a rounded rectangle out of the background, blurring it, applying the transparent color on it and pasting it back in. Unfortunately I couldn\u0027t figure out how to just crop a rounded rectangle. Maybe by using some rounded rectangle mask while pasting?\r\n\r\nAny ideas how realize my seconds thought (if possible) or are there better ways to do that?",
