  "body": "Hi, I am really sorry for asking, but I dont know where can I ask about it.\r\n\r\nThe problem: I am trying to use skia native for wasm, but I get errors like this:\r\n\r\nwasm-ld: error: duplicate symbol: jsimd_can_rgb_ycc\r\n\u003E\u003E\u003E defined in /var/folders/18/99jndmds6px_w52xph7yfc_h0000gn/T/tmp86_sx22cWebGLSupport_ImageConversionModule_Dynamic.a(External_libjpeg-turbo_src_0_j00uw.o)\r\n\u003E\u003E\u003E defined in Assets/Scenes/Plugins/WebGL/libSkiaSharp.a(libjpeg.jsimd_none.o)\r\n\r\nwasm-ld: error: duplicate symbol: jsimd_can_rgb_gray\r\n\u003E\u003E\u003E defined in /var/folders/18/99jndmds6px_w52xph7yfc_h0000gn/T/tmp86_sx22cWebGLSupport_ImageConversionModule_Dynamic.a(External_libjpeg-turbo_src_0_j00uw.o)\r\n\u003E\u003E\u003E defined in Assets/Scenes/Plugins/WebGL/libSkiaSharp.a(libjpeg.jsimd_none.o)\r\n\r\nwasm-ld: error: duplicate symbol: jsimd_can_ycc_rgb\r\n\u003E\u003E\u003E defined in /var/folders/18/99jndmds6px_w52xph7yfc_h0000gn/T/tmp86_sx22cWebGLSupport_ImageConversionModule_Dynamic.a(External_libjpeg-turbo_src_0_j00uw.o)\r\n\u003E\u003E\u003E defined in Assets/Scenes/Plugins/WebGL/libSkiaSharp.a(libjpeg.jsimd_none.o)\r\n\r\nand so on... And yes, I am using Unity3d and trying to make it work in wasm. I think that unity already has some of libraries from libSkiaSharp.a (libjpeg as I can see). So maybe there is any way to exclude libjpeg.jsimd_none.o on build? Or maybe I can rebuild native skia without them. Thanks for any advice :)",
