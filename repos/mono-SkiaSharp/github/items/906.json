  "body": "Good morning,\r\n\r\nTrying to implement a pdf export from skia sharp drawings, using api .CreatePdf(stream, metadata)), in a xamarin forms project that targets UWP.\r\n\r\nReally struggling to get it implemented, particularly at the save/create stage - I was wondering if there is any way to receive some assistance on implementing it? I\u0027ve followed the documentation here https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/blob/master/samples/Gallery/Shared/Samples/CreatePdfSample.cs#L47\r\n\r\nbut I must be doing something wrong, the file doesnt save after calling pdfCanvas.DrawBitmap and  document.Close();.\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance\r\n",
