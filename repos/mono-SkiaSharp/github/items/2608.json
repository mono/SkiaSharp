Update mono\u0027s skia fork.\r\n2. Release a new SkiaSharp version which isn\u0027t vulnerable to CVE-2023-4863 anymore.\r\n3. Update the GHSA for CVE-2023-4863 (https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j7hp-h8jx-5ppr) so that dependents get alerted of the vulnerability in SkiaSharp. (Happy to take care of that myself otherwise when a new release is available)\r\n\r\nThank you!\n\n### Code\n\nn/a\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Version of SkiaSharp\n\n2.88.3 (Current)\n\n### Last Known Good Version of SkiaSharp\n\nOther (Please indicate in the description)\n\n### IDE / Editor\n\nOther (Please indicate in the description)\n\n### Platform / Operating System\n\nAll\n\n### Platform / Operating System Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Devices\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant Log Output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project\u0027s Code of Conduct",
