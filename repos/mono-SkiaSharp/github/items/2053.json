  "body": "I\u0027m currently developing a Azure funtion that generates a PDF file using QuestPDF and SkiaSharp.\r\nBut whenever I try to execute the function without any assembly reference error I still get this issue:\r\n\r\n\u003E SkiaSharp.SKAbstractManagedWStream\u0027 threw an exception\r\n\u003E    at SkiaSharp.SKAbstractManagedWStream..ctor(Boolean owns)\r\n\u003E    at SkiaSharp.SKDocument.CreatePdf(Stream stream, SKDocumentPdfMetadata metadata)\r\n\u003E    at QuestPDF.Drawing.DocumentGenerator.GeneratePdf(Stream stream, IDocument document)\r\n\u003E    at QuestPDF.Fluent.GenerateExtensions.GeneratePdf(IDocument document, Stream stream)\r\n\r\nI wonder, **is there any way to implement SkiaSharp with QuestPDF on a Azure Function V3 on netcore3.1 without using the publish function from VS?**\r\n\r\nI used the .proj file on the function with no positive result.\r\nWhen I try to execute the same code on Visual Studio it does work with no problem at all.\r\n\r\nI don\u0027t get any assembly issues but I do get that exception.\r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated, thanks!!\r\n\r\n[EDIT]: In case that any code is needed I can share some of it!",

I am wondering if the SDK has made improvements.\r\n\r\nIt is somekind related to [#1001](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/issues/1001) but all the solutions given where mentioning the .csproj or .proj file, none of them work without using the Publish feature from Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBut this error comes directly from the library itself. What I mean is, the error given by the function is not because the library couldn\u0027t find libSkiaSharp.dll, I assume it\u0027s because **System.Memory.dll** is not updated.\r\n\r\nAnd no, I haven\u0027t tried on NET6, I\u0027ll try it and I\u0027ll keep you updated.\r\n\r\nNOTE: When importing the reference from both SkiaSharp and QuestPDF the function start to log many outdated references or a lot of \u0022obsolete\u0022 references.",
