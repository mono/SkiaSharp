  "title": "Add a property to the views to indicate the scale",
  "body": "Because the SkiaSharp views are using actual device pixels, this may be unexpected for some apps. I think we should expose two options:\n1. A property to indicate the current scale\n   This is especially noticeable on UWP when dragging the window from a hi-res display to a low res monitor, the image should stay the same size when drawing with the same coordinates.\n2. A property to enable automatic scaling\n   Currently, the rendering is done with device pixels, an option to draw with \u0022base\u0022 pixels and automatically scale\n\nThese options might have a secondary option to indicate whether to scale the completed image (draw a bitmap of 100x100, but then scaling it up to 200x200 when blitting - may cause blurring) or to scale all drawing operations (drawing a bitmap of 200x200, but all draw operations are scaled up).\n",
