        "body": "That is very weird... the \u0060sk_canvas_set_matrix\u0060 is the C API, which will call into C\u002B\u002B and not ever need to call back out to the C layer. In fact the C\u002B\u002B API knows nothing of the C API. The \u0060gr_backendrendertarget_get_gl_framebufferinfo\u0060. Are you calling \u0060GetGlFramebufferInfo\u0060 at all in your code? For those two to be together is weird enough for me to think that maybe there is something wrong with the symbols.\r\n\r\nDo you have some render loop going? Or is this a pure, \u0022just put it on the screen and it breaks\u0022 issue?\r\n\r\nCould you attach a sample that you can confirm crashes, maybe the source and the even the fully compiled app. Then I\u0027ll run it and try find out exactly what is going on.\r\n\r\nI looked at the other crashes in that gist, and there is a surprising number of \u0060gr_backendrendertarget_get_gl_framebufferinfo\u0060 items on the stack. Which only comes up if YOU call \u0060GetGlFramebufferInfo\u0060, which is often not the case.",

        "body": "Hi folks, sorry about the delay. I am looking into this still, and I am trying to locate exactly what is causing this. I have been collecting issues and thanks to several of you in the community, I have a few samples and more information that will help as I look into this.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I did get \u0022distracted\u0022 by some other issues in this project as well as some other projects that needed my attention. However, I am back on this! And, I will be focusing on finding a solution ASAP this whole week.\r\n\r\n@gregsn this Windows thing is interesting and might be a better way to debug as I can work more easily there. Do you have a sample code that you can share? Also, what version of VS, Windows and NuGet are you using?",

I created 30\u002B views and it ran all night. Typically with about 30\u002B views it would crash at 500\r\n\r\nCheck out the package version: 1.68.2-pr.1180.1",
