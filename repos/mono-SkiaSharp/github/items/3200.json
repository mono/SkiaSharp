I know you/this PR is refactoring things, but after my PR there will be only one Docker file. Hopefully. We may still need this refactoring if we merge the #3198 PR to add LoongArch64. That looks like it may need Debian 13 so may be worth a totally separate Dockerfile if things go a bit different.\r\n\r\nNot sure if you have any thoughts on my PR?",
