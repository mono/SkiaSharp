  "title": "[FEATURE] Add Blazor ServerSide support",
  "body": "At this moment I have 2 ways to run my application: Blazor WebAssembly (for production) and Blazor ServerSide (for a faster and better debugging experience).\r\n\r\nAt this moment SkiaSharp does not support Blazor ServerSide:\r\n\r\n\u003E  Unhandled exception rendering component: SkiaSharp currently only works on Web Assembly\r\n\r\n\r\nCould support for ServerSide be added to SkiaSharp? Or is it related to this issue: https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/issues/1834 ?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!",
