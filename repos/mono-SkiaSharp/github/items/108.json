  "body": "Hi!\n\nI am trying to store SKBitmaps that I created with SkiaSharp as PNG files.\n\nMiguel pointed out that:\n\n\u003E If you have an SKBitmap, you can call:\n\u003E \n\u003E var data = bitmap.Encode (SKImageEncodeFormat.Png, quality: 100);\n\u003E using (var f = File.Create (\u0022foo.png\u0022))\n\u003E    data.SaveTo (f);\n\nHowever, SKBitmap has no such \u0022Encode\u0022 method.\nOnly SKImage has.\n\nSo I need this method either in SKBitmap, or a conversion method as the one that exists in Skia:\n\n\u0060static sk_sp\u003CSkImage\u003E MakeFromBitmap(const SkBitmap\u0026);\u0060\n\nsee SKImage.h\nhttps://github.com/google/skia/blob/master/include/core/SkImage.h \n\nI tried to do the conversion in C# code, but failed miserably - you can see a documentation of my attempts in this closed issue:\nhttps://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/issues/103 \n",
