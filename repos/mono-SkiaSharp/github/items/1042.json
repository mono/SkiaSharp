But, it appears that the ref folder overrides ALL the platforms.\r\n\r\nThis typically is fine if the APIs are the same, but because we have more public types (such as SKImageSourceHandler) in the iOS (and the others) this doesn\u0027t work.\r\n\r\nFixing this in https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/pull/1044 and I hope to push this out ASAP. I have a few fixes in there as well.",
