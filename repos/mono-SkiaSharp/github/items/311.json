  "body": "As mentioned by @hurricanehrndz (https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/issues/90#issuecomment-307112384), there is not that much needed to build on linux, and the dependency on \u0060mono\u0060, \u0060dotnet\u0060 and \u0060cake\u0060 is a bit overkill just to run \u0060make\u0060:\r\n\r\nReasons for current state (https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/issues/90#issuecomment-307124367):\r\n - I didn\u0027t know make or linux at the time of starting\r\n - building native skia was a bit herder when I started (few extra steps)\r\n\r\nThis is the previous linux issue: https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/issues/90",
