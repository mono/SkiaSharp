  "title": "[QUESTION] Compare contrast with JS libraries",
  "body": "Q: How does _Skia(Sharp)_ compare contrast with JS libraries like [_Babylon_](https://babylonjs.com) of [_THREE_](https://threejs.org)? Aside from the obvious, I get it, the \u0060CSharp\u0060 interop aspects. Also, that the JS libraries are purely JS canvas oriented. But perhaps in a bit more depth, insightfulness. Thank you...",
