        "body": "You may have to set \u0060e.Handled = true\u0060, this is because you could opt to ignore touches without having to unsubscribe from events.\r\n\r\nFor example, assume you have a canvas that draws blocks and you want to drag the blocks. If the user taps on a block, you set \u0060Handled = true\u0060 and then you get all the events. If the user taps the space, there is nothing more for you todo so you can do nothing or set \u0060Handled = false\u0060 and you will not get any further events.\r\n\r\nThis was modeled after:\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.handledmouseeventargs.handled\r\n\r\n\u003E You will want to use [HandledMouseEventArgs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.handledmouseeventargs?view=windowsdesktop-6.0) primarily when developing a control that needs to handle mouse wheel events itself, and prevent them from being seen by the control\u0027s immediate parent container.",

Why the behavior is different?",
