        "body": "So, I had a look and tested a few things.\r\n\r\nWhat I found was that UWP works in that as soon as you start drawing, it captures the pointer and won\u0027t scroll. This PR will fix it for Android.\r\n\r\nI checked iOS and there is no easy way to prevent the bubbling of events, so it always scrolls. I fill that it is correct to stop scrolling, so we should probably fix iOS as well.\r\n\r\nNot sure what Tizen, macOS, WPF will do.\r\n\r\nBut then again, maybe UWP is wrong. If you want to work with gestures and touch evens inside the canvas, you either disable the scroll on the scrollview, or you don\u0027t put the canvas inside the scrollview.\r\n\r\n",

Having just tested with the native SkiaSharp touch, we also do see a problem on iOS",

Almost 3 weeks past without any responses and I have feeling that it won\u0027t be changed in foreseeable future. No, really, I understand why - \u0060ScrollOrientation.Neither\u0060 was added relatively recently and there are much more important bugs to fix. \r\n\r\n\u003E The correct way would be to track the touch events, and when you start dragging, you disable the scroll.\r\n\r\nBut currently, as far as I can tell, there is no such way, isn\u0027t it?\r\n\r\nI do think having a fix (even temporary) much better than nothing.\r\n",
