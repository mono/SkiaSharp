Sorry about the conflict. \n\nThis might be interesting to you: https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/commit/8db2bb0534934d054acf0f98ab273bed1234566d Basically, you can tell the bitmap which pixels (memory block) to use, and when it is finished it will invoke a callback to dispose of the pixel memory correctly. See the test: https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/commit/8db2bb0534934d054acf0f98ab273bed1234566d#diff-bb90be898c3b02230b061ed89cb39a5aR11\n\nI see this as creating a bitmap from an existing memory location. Similar to a surface from pixels, but in this instance the bitmap can be drawn onto something else - a surface can\u0027t be drawn on another surface. eg: using some native codec not supported by SkiaSharp, then pass the memory location to a bitmap - which you can then draw somewhere, or even draw on that image.\n",
