The new regex is more precise and robust, ensuring correct parsing of the label even when additional metadata is present.\r\n\r\nBuild variable extraction improvement:\r\n\r\n* Updated the regex pattern in \u0060scripts/set-build-variables.ps1\u0060 to handle build run names with or without additional metadata after a plus sign (\u0060\u002B\u0060), improving the accuracy of the preview label extraction.",
