  "body": "Hello @mattleibow ... We\u0027ve discussed this at least once with Dan Roth (offline IIRC), but you didn\u0027t respond to my latest offline (email) message, so I hope to reach you here on this.\r\n\r\nAs you know, we incorporated SkiaSharp into the official ASP.NET Core docs as an example of native dependency package use on https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/pull/23668 at ...\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor/webassembly-native-dependencies#skiasharp-example-library-use\r\n\r\nCurrently, your package is in preview, and we typically have strong cautionary statements in official docs about not trusting experimental/preview packages in production apps. We remove those remarks when a package reaches RTM/GA by its maintainers and then only say that the 3rd party package isn\u0027t supported by MS.\r\n\r\nFor [\u0060SkiaSharp.Views.Blazor\u0060](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SkiaSharp.Views.Blazor), are you close to a 1.0.0 RTM/GA release?",
