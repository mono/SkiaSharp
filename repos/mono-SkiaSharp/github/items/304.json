  "title": "Forms: SKCanvasView in ListView glitch",
  "body": "I got an issue with a SKCanvasView when used in a list.  The list is dynamically resized and after many many many redraws, the contexts seem to get messed up and they swap from one row to the other.  So in the following sample, just tap on the names repeatedly (around 20-30 times should do the trick).  My guess is that the bug is alwas there but the amount of redraws makes it easier to reproduce in the below sample.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/LeRondPoint/FormsSkiaBikeTracker/tree/SKCanvasViewBug\r\n\r\nThanks",
