  "body": "For most users of the common linux distros (Ubuntu, Debian, Red Hat, OpenSUSE, etc) it may be possible to distribute a binary in the NuGet package.\r\n\r\nThere are some limitations and reason why this is not such a good idea, but this is just an issue to track this thought.\r\n\r\nJust want to link the main, but old, linux issue: https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/issues/90\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo make life easier for everyone, I moved code around and added a new target to the GN files. Now, the native libSkiaSharp build is done with GN and ninja directly: https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/wiki/Building-on-Linux",

        "body": "For people looking for prebuilt binaries: there is [a prebuilt nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Avalonia.Skia.Linux.Natives/) maintained by AvaloniaUI team. Despite the name it only contains \u0060libSkiaSharp.so\u0060. For docker images provided by microsoft you need to install \u0060libfontconfig1\u0060 package via apt-get.\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\nRegarding providing prebuilt binaries in official package:\r\n\r\nPlease, link libstdc\u002B\u002B statically and use something with sufficiently old GLIBC as your build machine. This will allow to produce a single binary for almost every modern distro.\r\n\r\nUbuntu 14.04 is a good candidate for that since it  has GLIBC 2.19 and modern compiler toolchain available from official repositories",

        "body": "All right folks, I have been doing some work and I think I am able to meet you in the middle of \u0022we don\u0027t really support Linux as it is not a priority\u0022 and \u0022using Linux is a real pain because of X\u0022. Let me know what you think of this:\r\n\r\nI have created a new package \u0060SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.Linux\u0060 that will be going out with v1.68.0 that I would like to try. It will just contain the various Linux binaries that I have built and tested on. Right now, this is just going to be the binary I build on Ubuntu 16.04 amd64. I have done some testing and it appears to work on several distros (Ubuntu 14, OpenSUSe and CentOS), so I am going to put it in the \u0060linux-x64\u0060 runtime folder. _(This may not work on alpine just yet - haven\u0027t tested - but I can always add a more specific build when I can.)_\r\n\r\nThe overall result of this is that you will do everything as usual, but in the \u0022app\u0022 part of the solution, just add the package. You should not release a NuGet to nuget.org that depends on this directly as you will then force all your uses to use my binary.\r\n\r\nAn example of a use case where a separate package is useful is this:\r\n - Matthew builds \u0060SkiaSharp\u0060 and a binary for Ubuntu 16.\r\n - John builds an Ubuntu app and includes the \u0060SkiaSharp\u0060 and \u0060SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.Linux\u0060 packages. John is very happy.\r\n - Janet builds an Alpine app and includes \u0060SkiaSharp\u0060 and her custom build of \u0060libSkiaSharp.so\u0060. Janet is not as happy as John. Janet has SKILLZ and can build for Alpine.\r\n - Joe is a great guy. Joe likes community. Joe likes Alpine Linux. Joe builds \u0060libSkiaSharp.so\u0060 for Alpine. Joe creates a new NuGet package (\u0060JoesCodes.SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.Alpine\u0060) that just contains the Alpine binary.\r\n - Jane is also building for Alpine. Jane uses the \u0060JoesCodes.SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.Alpine\u0060 package. Jane is happy.\r\n - Matthew has a look at \u0060JoesCodes.SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.Alpine\u0060 and sees **1 million downloads**! Matthew is blown away. Matthew knows everyone is using Alpine. Matthew has a chat to Big Boss: \u0022We NEED Alpine\u0022. Big Boss has a look. Big Boss agrees. Matthew builds for Alpine and adds it to the \u0060SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.Linux\u0060 package. Everyone is happy.\r\n - Janet and Jane now have options: use \u0022official\u0022 or use \u0022community\u0022. Janet is very happy. Jane is very happy.\r\n    - Janet is Matthew\u0027s friend. Janet decides to use \u0060SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.Linux\u0060. Janet and Matthew are happy.\r\n    - Jane is happy with \u0060JoesCodes.SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.Alpine\u0060. Jane is Joe\u0027s friend. Jane does not change.\r\n - Joe also has options: keep independent and free, or, update \u0060JoesCodes.SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.Alpine\u0060 to be an empty shell package with a dependency.\r\n    - Joe decides to update to depend on Matthew.\r\n       - Janet updates. Janet is happy.\r\n       - Jane updates. Jane gets the new package that gets Matthew\u0027s build. Jane is happy.\r\n    - Joe stays free and builds the next version.\r\n       - Janet updates. Janet is happy.\r\n       - Jane updates. Jane gets Joe\u0027s new package. Jane is happy.\r\n\r\n_(Hope you folks like my story about Matthew and the Big Boss working to make life better for John, Janet, Joe and Jane. I had fun.)_",
