  "title": "[BUG] Issue when converting DOCX to PDF with Syncfusion DocIO on Windows Server Docker container",
  "body": "**Description**\r\n\r\nWe are using the DocIO component from the Syncfusion framework for converting DOCX documents to PDF, and we are having issues with versions up from 17.1.0.32-beta paired with version 1.68.0 of SkiaSharp when trying to convert documents in our Windows Docker container. We have tried many combinations of DocIO and SkiaSharp, always having in mind the compatible version specified in NuGet Dependencies, but we get the same result unless with use specifically 17.1.0.32-beta with SkiaSharp 1.68.0. \r\n\r\nWe\u0027ve already contacted their support team asking for help, but they seem to be having issues with the creation of a reproducible example. We don\u0027t know if we are missing something from the SkiaSharp side of the issue, so that\u0027s why we ask :). Hope you can provide any insight on any issue in relation to Windows Docker containers and SkiaSharp\r\n\r\n**Code**\r\nOur code for the conversion is the following:\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060CSharp\r\nusing DocIORenderer converter = new DocIORenderer();\r\n\r\nusing MemoryStream docxMemoryStream = new MemoryStream(File.ReadAllBytes(pathToDocxFile));\r\n\r\nusing WordDocument wordDocument = new WordDocument(docxMemoryStream, FormatType.Docx);\r\n\r\n// Here the Syncfusion library internally uses SkiaSharp for the conversion.\r\nusing PdfDocumnet pdfDocument = converter.ConvertToPDF(wordDocument);\r\n\r\nusing MemoryStream pdfMemoryStream = new MemoryStream();\r\n\r\npdfDocument.Save(pdfMemoryStream);\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nThe converted document should look like this:\r\n![789996bb5f8051d73a3ebc8eea0a9370](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29706923/147260120-85c1463c-b82a-4cf8-a925-3b68e356d3d0.png)\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\nThe converted document currently looks like this:\r\n![ada0fc07d7e67dde6d09f6d03a866ae8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29706923/147260214-7ec430b8-7de6-472a-9a48-0dcf561904b3.png)\r\n\r\n**Basic Information**\r\n\r\n- Version with issue:  2.80.3\r\n- Last known good version:  1.68.0\r\n- IDE:  Visual Studio 2019\r\n- Platform Target Frameworks:\r\n  - ASP.NET Core process on a \r\n- Target Devices:\r\n  - Windows Server Docker container.\r\n  \r\n\u003Cdetails\u003E\r\n  \u003Csummary\u003EWindows Server Docker file summary\u003E\r\n  \r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060Dockerfile\r\n\r\n# Setting the base image.\r\n# This command specifies the base image that will be used.\r\n# This image is produced by Microsoft, and it contains the base image for Windows Server.\r\n# This implies that the service is run with Kestrel and not inside IIS.\r\n# Remarks:\r\n# - This image is used instead of the mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/aspnet:3.1 used in other services because of a Syncfusion dependency: SkiaSharp.\r\n#   This library cannot be run in a NanoServer until the GitHub\u0027s issue NugGet/Home/8894 is solved.\r\nFROM mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2019\r\n\r\n# Setting the arguments.\r\nARG source\r\nARG environment\r\n\r\n# Installing the .NET Core runtime.\r\n# The hosting exe is used instead of runtime because it contains ASP.NET Core dependencies.\r\nCOPY dotnet-hosting-*.exe C:/dotnet-hosting.exe\r\nRUN dotnet-hosting.exe /quiet /install\r\n\r\n# Setting the environment variables.\r\nENV ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT ${environment:-Development}\r\n\r\nENV ASPNETCORE_URLS http://*:80\r\n\r\n# Setting the working directory.\r\n# This command creates and sets the path to the /app folder.\r\nWORKDIR /app\r\n\r\n# Copying the application files.\r\n# This command copies the files from a folder called ServicesBinaries into a folder called /app in the container.\r\n# The ServicesBinaries folder does not exist at the moment, but it will be created when the Integration build publishes the binaries as artifacts.\r\nCOPY ${source:-ServicesBinaries} .\r\n\r\n# Exposing the HTTP port.\r\n# This command makes port 80 available for HTTP traffic from outside the container.\r\nEXPOSE 80\r\n\r\n# Running the application.\r\n# This command runs the dotnet command line tool to execute the service.\r\nENTRYPOINT [\u0022dotnet\u0022, \u0022PdfConverter.dll\u0022]\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\u003C/details\u003E",
