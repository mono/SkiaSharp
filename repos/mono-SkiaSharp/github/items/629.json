  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nHi, I\u0027m trying to use SkiaSharp to merge a few images. To do that I was trying to create a surface using \u0060SKImageInfo\u0060 obtained from the first image but the resulting image was brighter than I expected.\r\nIt turned out that \u0060AlphaType\u0060 for the same image that comes from \u0060DecodeBouns\u0060 is different than \u0060AlphaType\u0060 that comes from \u0060Decode\u0060 method. When I used an \u0060AlphaType\u0060 that comes from the \u0060Decode\u0060 method then everything started to work.\r\n\r\n### Code\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060C#\r\nvar firstImageInfo = SKBitmap.DecodeBounds(firstImageDataSource.ImageData); // ImageData is type of SKData\r\nvar firstImage = SKBitmap.Decode(firstImageDataSource.ImageData);\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n\u0060firstImageInfo.AlphaType == firstImage.Info.AlphaType\u0060\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n\u0060firstImageInfo.AlphaType\u0060 is different than \u0060firstImage.Info.AlphaType\u0060\r\n\r\n### Basic Information\r\n\r\n- Version with issue:  1.60.3\r\n- Last known good version:  \u003C!-- the version of SkiaSharp that still working --\u003E\r\n- IDE:  Rider\r\n- Platform Target Frameworks: .NET Core 2.0\r\n  - Windows Classic:  Windows 10\r\n- Target Devices:\r\n  - PC\r\n",
