        "body": "I just want to thank you for this PR, and inform you that SVG support has moved from this repository to one that is more appropriate: https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp.Extended\r\n\r\nThis new repository will make it easier to develop libraries that use SkiaSharp, but don\u0027t really have to be built with the main library. In addition, there will be no need to first build all the native code, just to test a fix for some SVG case.\r\n\r\nPlease open a new PR against this new repository, and we will be happy to merge it in.",
