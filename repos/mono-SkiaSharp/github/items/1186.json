  "body": "SkiaSharp canvas view events always have touch device type even when touched with a pen.\r\n\r\nSkCanvasView.OnTouch() events:\r\nSKTouchEventArgs has a Touch device type which always registers as a \u201Ctouch\u201D event. on Android at\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/blob/b8511b732b77b6e9f3b4929a5fa5598d189adf1d/source/SkiaSharp.Views.Forms/SkiaSharp.Views.Forms.Android/SKTouchHandler.cs\r\n\r\nThe event is being created using the constructor that doesn\u2019t have the device ID :\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\nvar args = new SKTouchEventArgs(id, SKTouchAction.Pressed, coords, true);\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060 \r\n\r\nWhich is then defaulting to touch:\r\n \r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\npublic SKTouchEventArgs(long id, SKTouchAction type, SKPoint location, bool inContact)\r\n    : this(id, type, SKMouseButton.Left, SKTouchDeviceType.Touch, location, inContact, 0)\r\n{\r\n}\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you\u0027d like**\r\nin the SkTouchHandler.OnTouch, set the SkTouchEventArgs DeviceType based on the MotionEvent device type.\r\nYou can find the type under the motionevent property of the args then calling GetToolType on it \r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/android.views.motionevent.gettooltype?view=xamarin-android-sdk-9#Android_Views_MotionEvent_GetToolType_System_Int32_\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you\u0027ve considered**\r\nnone found\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nnone",

        "body": "This is a good idea to add. It looks like you already did some research, so you may have some ideas and code already. If so, just open a PR and we can talk code.\r\n\r\nWe don\u0027t have this feature yet just because I never did it. And nobody asked. But now you have \uD83D\uDE04 \r\n\r\nThat \u0060MotionEvent.GetToolType(int)\u0060 member seems to be a API 14\u002B member, so you might just need to wrap it in a OS version check. But we can add that after we got the code actually working - just in case we have to adjust things. Or you can do it all in one go.\r\n\r\nAnyways, from the looks of things, you should just be able to get the tool type and then use the overload of \u0060SKTouchEventArgs\u0060 that takes it.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in writing the code, then just go ahead and try out things, open a PR and then you can add PR comments or start a discussion.\r\n\r\nOh, and thanks for the issue and the initial research.",
