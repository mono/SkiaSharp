  "body": "**Description**\r\n\r\nWithout any changes to our code and the same svg\u0027s, svg\u0027s with multiple path tags appear just fine on 2.80.4 but don\u0027t appear on 2.88.x\r\n\r\n**Code**\r\n\r\nI have created a dummy xamarin app just for android, but we have the same issue with iOS with our app. I created a git repo for it here [https://github.com/fverdou/SkiaSharpIssue](https://github.com/fverdou/SkiaSharpIssue)\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nWell not exactly \u0022expected\u0022 as I don\u0027t know if this is an actual bug or if we need to change our code for it to work properly with 2.88.x versions.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\nWhen I had 2.80.4 versions of SkiaSharp and SkiaSharp.Views.Forms the result was this:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40397896/224068462-0fec671a-202a-426b-891a-a6e2ba84bc2d.png)\r\nBut after updating to 2.88.3 this is the result without changing anything in the code:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40397896/224068652-d7051c30-58ad-48e8-b2d8-676e76983710.png)\r\nYou can see in the embedded resources the difference. The working svg has only one path tag but the other has multiple.\r\n\r\nReverting back to 2.80.4 made both SVGs render again like in the first picture.\r\n\r\n**Basic Information**\r\n\r\n- Version with issue:  2.88.x \r\n- Last known good version:  2.80.4\r\n- IDE:  Visual Studio Community 2022 (64-bit) Version 17.5.1\r\n- Platform Target Frameworks:\r\n  - Android: Android 13.0 API Level 33\r\n- Target Device: Huawei Mate 9 model MHA-L09 with 9.1.0 EMUI and Android 9\r\n  \r\n\u003Cdetails\u003E\r\n  \r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\n(I don\u0027t know what to add here. If you need more info let me know)\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\u003C/details\u003E",

        "body": "Any news regarding this? I have given everything I could, created a test mobile app, you can see our dirty code and how we manipulate the kind of svg\u0027s we work with. Now svg\u0027s with tags like \u003Ca:linearGradient\u003E were added and they do not get rendered at all on 2.80.4 that we are still using. Any insights about how to correctly render any kind of svg, no matter if it has multiple paths, x/y attributes in \u003Ca:svg\u003E tags, or misses transforms, etc, with SkiaSharp, latest or older, would be greatly appreciated.",

This is an official Microsoft library used by millions that it seems it has reached its full potential. The comment you attached was from 2019 and SkiaSharp has been updated many times since then. So unless you have any constructive feedback regarding our weird use of it, please stop following this issue.",
