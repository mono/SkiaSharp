  "body": "I\u0027m trying to load big size image (39.1 MB, dimensions: 5494x5839) into a SKCanvas, enable drawing on it, and save the canvas as new .png image.\r\nBut the new image loses the quality, it\u0027s saved as 1.71 MB size with the device dimensions.\r\nWhy the canvas is saved as lower resolution than the original image? Does SKCanvas not supported big size images?\r\n",
