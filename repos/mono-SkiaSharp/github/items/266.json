It is still experimental from skia side - https://skia.org/user/api/canvas#skxps\r\n\r\nRight now I am in the process of updating the underlying skia to the next version (m57) and this uses a new build system. So the first v1.57.0 release may or may not have XPS, but I think the next version (v1.57.1) should have.\r\n\r\nThe build changes are fairly large as they don\u0027t really have great support for non macOS/Android devices. Thus, I have been adding iOS/tvOS and doing quite a bit for UWP.",
