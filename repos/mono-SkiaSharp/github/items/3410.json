Updated in commit 90adf3b:\n\n**Corrected versions:**\n- .NET support: Changed from just \u0022.NET 6\u0022 to \u0022.NET 6, 7, 8, 9\u0022 (verified in UtilsManaged.cake)\n- Xcode: Updated from \u002214\u002B\u0022 to \u002215.4 or later\u0022 (per azure-templates-variables.yml)\n- .NET SDK: Specified 8.0.304\u002B recommended (per DOTNET_VERSION in build config)\n\n**Verified accurate:**\n- Android platform versions (21-34)\n- Python 3.x requirement\n- Visual Studio 2022\n- All platform support (MAUI, WinUI 3, etc.)\n- View packages and controls\n\nAll version numbers now match the actual build requirements in \u0060scripts/azure-templates-variables.yml\u0060.",
