  "title": "[BUG] AngleSwapChainPanel SizeChanged event handler calls Invalidate before updating back buffer size",
  "body": "**Description**\r\n\r\nWhen resizing a desktop window filled with a SKGLView I noticed that the far right or bottom edge was sometimes white after the resize. In my OnPaintSurface method the e.BackendRenderTarget.Width/Height are the values from before the window resize. Looking at the implementation of AngleSwapChainPanel.OnSizeChanged() I don\u0027t see the back buffer size being updated before the call to Invalidate().\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nI would expect the back buffer resize to have happened before the call to OnPaintSurface().\r\n\r\n**Basic Information**\r\n\r\n- Version with issue:  1.68\r\n- IDE:  VS2019\r\n- Platform Target Frameworks:\r\n  - UWP:  16299\r\n- Target Devices:\r\n  - Desktop PC\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1683504/61475818-7e17c980-a940-11e9-9f60-5f61bb54911a.png)\r\n\r\nNote the white right and bottom edges. This is after the resize.\r\n",
