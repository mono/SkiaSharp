  "title": "Add support for path gradient shader in SKShader Class",
  "body": "### Is your feature request related to a problem?\n\nWe aim to achieve a path gradient effect using the SkiaSharp library. However, there isn\u0027t a shader effect available that replicates the path gradient functionality found in the **System.Drawing** library.\r\n\r\nWe are expecting a **SKShader.CreatePathGradient()** method in [SKShader](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/skiasharp.skshader?view=skiasharp-2.88) Class.\r\n\r\nPlease refer the below System.Drawing reference links,\r\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/winforms/advanced/how-to-create-a-path-gradient?view=netframeworkdesktop-4.8\r\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.drawing.drawing2d.pathgradientbrush?view=windowsdesktop-9.0\r\n\r\n**Note:** We are focusing on cross-platform rendering, which means we cannot utilize System.Drawing APIs.\n\n### Describe the solution you would like\n\nWe are expecting a **SKShader.CreatePathGradient()** method in [SKShader](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/skiasharp.skshader?view=skiasharp-2.88) Class, which works more similar to [PathGradientBrush](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.drawing.drawing2d.pathgradientbrush?view=windowsdesktop-9.0).\n\n### Describe alternatives you have considered\n\nCurrently, we are using [Radial Gradient Shader](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/skiasharp.skshader?view=skiasharp-2.88#radial-gradient-shader-example) as an alternative for **Path Gradient Shader**.\n\n### Additional context\n\nOur requirement is to draw the path gradient effect in image file as similar to Microsoft Word.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project\u0027s Code of Conduct",
