  "body": "### Is your feature request related to a problem?\n\nI have been trying for about 5 hours to get this to work for Unity WebGL. \uD83D\uDE2D\nI have downloaded the managed SkiaSharp nuget and the Native.Windows and Native.Android and Native.WebAssemebly nugets.\nI have so far got it to run on Windows and Android. \uD83D\uDE04\nBut I haven\u0027t been able to get it to run on WebGL. I have tried placing all the different libSkiaSharp.a files in Unity, and tried different versions of Unity 2021.2, 2022.3 etc. \n\n[It should work](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.2/Documentation/Manual/webgl-native-plugins-with-emscripten.html) according to the Unity docs.\n\nBut it keeps telling me in the Browser console:  DLLNotFound libSkiaSharp.\n\nI am not sure if this is because the managed C# dll is expecting a dynamic linked library instead of a static one(???). Is there something to change here?\n\nHas anyone got this working on Unity for WebGL? This would be great because I want to make programs with vector art that will run both on Standalone, Android and Web-browser, so I just need to get this to work and it will be perfect.\n\nIf anyone can get this to work on Unity, perhaps they can upload a sample Unity project to github? That would be fantastic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Describe the solution you would like\n\na sample unity project working in Unity WebGL.\n\n### Describe alternatives you have considered\n\neverything possible.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project\u0027s Code of Conduct",
