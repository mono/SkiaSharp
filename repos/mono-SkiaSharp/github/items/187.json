Also, did you install the SkiaSharp NuGet into all the relevant projects (PCL/iOS/Android/UWP)? \n\nFinally, are you able to check if the samples build for v1.54.1: \nhttps://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/releases/tag/v1.54.1\nFor this, you should download the source using the \u0022Source code (zip)\u0022 link at the bottom of the page. v1.55.0 is still in development.\n",
