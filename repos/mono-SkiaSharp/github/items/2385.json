  "body": "Hello. Thanks for your effort.\r\n\r\nMy question is, why is SkiaSharp trying to load \u0060liblibSkiaSharp\u0060 and is not satisfied with just \u0060libSkiaSharp.so\u0060?\r\n\r\nI\u0027m trying to run an Avalonia app on NixOS via\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\nLD_DEBUG=libs dotnet run\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\nAnd from the report I see:\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n    298115:\tfind library=libSkiaSharp.so [0]; searching\r\n    298115:\t search path=a lot of paths\t\t(LD_LIBRARY_PATH)\r\n    298115:\t  trying file=/nix/store/wkmc51s1nyyic7ym9c44k57wk8aqlpp9-icu4c-72.1/lib/libSkiaSharp.so\r\n    298115:\t  trying file=/nix/store/ljd6gmclp24spkhcmw7lqwch4bpbq9zp-skia-sharp/bin/libSkiaSharp.so\r\n    298115:\t\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\nLooks like it found \u0060libSkiaSharp.so\u0060 file (which I put there \u0022manually\u0022)\r\n\r\nBut then I see\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n    298115:\tfind library=liblibSkiaSharp.so [0]; searching\r\n    298115:\t search path=lots of paths here\t\t(LD_LIBRARY_PATH)\r\n    298115:\t  trying file=/nix/store/wkmc51s1nyyic7ym9c44k57wk8aqlpp9-icu4c-72.1/lib/liblibSkiaSharp.so\r\n    298115:\t  trying file=/nix/store/ljd6gmclp24spkhcmw7lqwch4bpbq9zp-skia-sharp/bin/liblibSkiaSharp.so\r\n    298115:\t  trying file=/nix/store/3zk3527zglm18ykrvgjdhgz3a4zrfapr-libX11-1.8.1/lib/liblibSkiaSharp.so\r\n    298115:\t  trying file=/nix/store/h99mc81gcsc6dsa4mfxgwjj812mljnkb-libICE-1.0.10/lib/liblibSkiaSharp.so\r\n    298115:\t  trying file=/nix/store/dqsgifv5pjfja5qzh9rjih1vqmfj86n9-libSM-1.2.3/lib/liblibSkiaSharp.so\r\n    298115:\t  trying file=/nix/store/sgw0sxwx46hqwlcm3d834f10p1qx7c5y-libX11-1.8.1-dev/lib/liblibSkiaSharp.so\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\nand it tries a lot of other paths, naturally, without success.

        "body": "It is just the lookup paths that the runtime tries. I think the first failure is the main issue:\n\n\u003E libfontconfig.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nYou may need to install fontconfig on the machine/container or use the NoDependencies version of the Linux binaries.\n\nI think the lookup versions are based on the fact that unit uses a lib prefix and windows does not. So when a library would load a MyLibrary dependency, windows had basically 1 version: MyLibrary.dll so it can try that. But to support a no-change-required run on Unix, the runtime checks with libMyLibrary and some other variants with .so or .so.1 extensions. ",

So for skiasharp may be NoDependencies could work, for QuestPDF it wos not enough. \r\nAnyway thank you a lot for trying to help.\r\nA.",
