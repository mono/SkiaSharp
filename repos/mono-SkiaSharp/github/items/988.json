        "body": "Thanks for taking the time to open this issue. This may not be exactly in the scope of SkiaSharp. We currently support exporting PNG, JPEG and WEBP files. There is also PDF if that is desired. In addition to those, there is experimental SVG and XPS file formats.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the SkiaSharp objects are not serializable since this is more a binding than an implementation. What this means is that for every object you see, there may be one or more native object that live in the C\u002B\u002B world. Unfortunately, this makes it hard to support serialization.\r\n\r\nWhat I would be more interested in, is why exporting to PNG or one of the other formats aren\u0027t working?",

My https://github.com/BretJohnson/XGraphics may be a better match for what you want to do, as those graphics primitives are serializable (at least that\u0027s the intent). It\u0027s a higher level abstraction. But mostly, I\u0027m just curious about your use case. Thanks.",
