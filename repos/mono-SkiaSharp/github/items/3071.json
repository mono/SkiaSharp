  "title": "[BUG] Wrong rendering scale on Windows with 2.88.9 stable",
  "body": "### Description\n\nOn Windows:\r\n\r\n1. 2.88.9-preview.2.2 and all previous render fine.\r\n2. 2.88.9 stable renders with incorrect scale.\r\n\r\nAny ideas about changed in SkiaSharp between these two releases that caused this?  \r\nI am using the correct rendering scale of 1.25 in both cases.  \r\nThough I get different results with different SkiaSharp nugets.  \r\nBoth CanvasView and SKGLView are affected.  \r\nThe only case when it renders identical between both nugets is a display with a rendering scale of 1.0.\r\n\r\nImages here: https://github.com/taublast/DrawnUi.Maui/issues/130\r\n\n\n### Code\n\nThe best way to share code for larger projects is a link to a GitHub repository: https://github.com/user/repo/tree/bug-123\r\n\r\nBut, you can also share a short block of code here:\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060cs\r\n// some C# code here\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\nYou can also share some XAML:\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060xaml\r\n\u003C!-- xaml code here --\u003E\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Version of SkiaSharp\n\n2.88.9 (Current)\n\n### Last Known Good Version of SkiaSharp\n\n2.88.8 (Previous)\n\n### IDE / Editor\n\nVisual Studio (Windows)\n\n### Platform / Operating System\n\nWindows\n\n### Platform / Operating System Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Devices\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant Log Output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project\u0027s Code of Conduct",
