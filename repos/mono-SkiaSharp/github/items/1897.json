Besides that there is a bug in the automatic resizing, I don\u0027t want the functionality at all for my project.\r\n\r\nI added parameter \u0027AutoResize\u0027 to SKGLView and SKCanvasView (which is true by default). When it is disabled, the SizeWatcherInterop won\u0027t be used.\r\n\r\nSee issue:\r\nhttps://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/issues/1896\r\n\r\nAdded: \r\n \r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n/// \u003Csummary\u003E\r\n/// If true (default), the canvas will be automatically resized to fit the client width and height. \r\n/// \u003C/summary\u003E\r\n[Parameter]\r\npublic bool AutoResize { get; set; } = true;\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060",
