  "title": "[QUESTION] Can I use Custom Pixel Shaders with SkiaSharp?",
  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have had a search around for similiar issues but couldn\u0027t see anything - apologies if this *is* already somewhere or this is the wrong place to ask!\r\n\r\nI am playing around with SkiaSharp a little bit (some basic porting of WPF graphics library so far) and one of the bits that I can\u0027t see how to do is being able to use a custom pixel shader (eg. HLSL/GLSL shader) - Is this something that is possible in Skia(sharp)? \r\n\r\n**Some background:**\r\nIn WPF I am using the base \u0027ShaderEffect\u0027 functionality, and HLSL shaders compiled to *.ps - Thinking of XPlatform I know would need to port these over to GLSL also, but wanted to know whether I could even use these custom shaders in SkiaSharp or if I would need to possibly re-implement the functionality from the shaders directly in SkiaSharp a different way. I\u0027ve been looking at SKShader \u0026 SKColorFilter but don\u0027t see anything to pass a custom shader too\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nMax",

On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being \u0022seems like a good idea\u0022 and 10 being \u0022totally working and recommended to use\u0022, I think we\u0027re at about a 2 today.\r\n",
