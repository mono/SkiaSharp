  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nThe download and install of SkiaSharp is potentially an issue with about 100MB of native files to pull down.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you\u0027d like**\r\nThe installation of SkiaSharp should only pull down the native assets that are actually required. If I install a package into Xamarin.iOS, don\u0027t pull down macOS, UWP, Android, and all the rest. 8MB is better than 100MB\r\n",

Is this really worth it?\r\n\r\n**Pros:**\r\n - smaller NuGet package\r\n - faster download\r\n\r\n**Cons:**\r\n - extra work / maintenance (I have to create a .targets file for each package as only netcoreapp is automatic)\r\n - more packages\r\n - potential for mismatched package versions\r\n - potential for duplicated assets (macOS is both used on netcoreapp and xamarinmac)\r\n\r\nSize is just a download number and has no relevance to the final app, or any relevance at all.\r\n\r\nAny opinions?",

UWP is a bit bigger at 18MB because it has ANGLE adn watchOS has bitcode which is pretty huge at 25MB",

        "body": "@mattleibow Thank you for this lib and splitting the native assets. But I have a few questions: \r\nWhat is the reason to reference specific native assets for netstandard? Anyone should have the choice which native assets are required.\r\nI think this is a kind of avoiding breaking changes. For people using SkiaSharp on linux there are breaking change because the extra references are required. So why not cleanup and remove not necessary references and let the user choose which assets are required?\r\n\r\nThe \u0060SkiaSharp\u0060 package for \u0060net462\u0060 can reference \u0060SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.Win32\u0060\r\nThe \u0060SkiaSharp\u0060 packages for \u0060netstandard1.3\u0060 and \u0060netstandard2.0\u0060 should not reference \u0060SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.Win32\u0060 and not \u0060SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.macOS\u0060.\r\n\r\n",
