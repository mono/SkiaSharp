I\u0027m not sure I\u0027m comfortable with a bot having admin access to my Github organizations, as those are tied to my professional life (these contributions are personal). I contacted Github support and there doesn\u0027t seem to be a way to disallow the bot access to my organizations. I may end up creating a new Github account for my professional work so that this can remain separate. If you want this PR but can\u0027t merge it until I sign the CLA, let me know and I\u0027ll expedite that process.\n",
