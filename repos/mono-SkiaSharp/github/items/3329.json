  "body": "### Description\n\nI\u0027m getting a build issue where SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.Linux v2.88.7 is being included as a transient package rather than v3.119.0. I\u0027m guessing, but believe this is due to SkiaSharp.csproj not referencing the SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.Linux project\n\n### Code\n\nAdd this to SkiaSharp.csproj:\n\n\u003CProjectReference Include=\u0022..\\SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.Tizen\\SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.Linux.csproj\u0022 Condition=\u0022$(TargetFramework.Contains(\u0027-linux\u0027))\u0022 /\u003E\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nLinux build to include the same version of all native assets as the version of SkiaSharp (3.119.0)\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nAn old version of Linux native assets is included (2.88.1) and the following error is thrown:\n\nSystem.TypeInitializationException : The type initializer for \u0027SkiaSharp.SKColorSpace\u0027 threw an exception.\n  ----\u003E System.TypeInitializationException : The type initializer for \u0027SkiaSharp.SKObject\u0027 threw an exception.\n  ----\u003E System.InvalidOperationException : The version of the native libSkiaSharp library (88.1) is incompatible with this version of SkiaSharp. Supported versions of the native libSkiaSharp library are in the range [119.0, 120.0).\n\n### Version of SkiaSharp\n\n3.116.0 (Current)\n\n### Last Known Good Version of SkiaSharp\n\n2.88.9 (Previous)\n\n### IDE / Editor\n\nVisual Studio (Windows), Other (Please indicate in the description)\n\n### Platform / Operating System\n\nLinux\n\n### Platform / Operating System Version\n\nOccurring in Linux runner in GitHub Action for CI\n\n### Devices\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant Log Output\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060shell\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project\u0027s Code of Conduct",

        "body": "Primarily, I\u0027d say that\u0027s a consequence of factors like Linux having multiple distros, C libraries etc. and needing a mechanism with NuGet to support the different configurations - you need some way to select the one that works for your particular case. Even on Windows it\u0027s a potential problem - 3.119.x is compiled against DX12 so it won\u0027t work out of the box on Windows 7 and earlier. It\u0027s not particularly uncommon for NuGets to take that approach. Not to mention that downloading all the native assets for every platform would take a bunch of potentially avoidable bandwidth and disk-space.\n\nhttps://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/discussions/3210\n",
