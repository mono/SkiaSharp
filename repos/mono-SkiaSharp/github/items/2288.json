The project doesnt have the maintainers or resources to keep up.\r\n\r\nIts a real shame because its a promising project, but its now so unmaintainable it cannot be updated.\r\n\r\nProposal: Remove all of those extra views and keep to just the bindings...\r\n\r\nBlazor, uno etc can maintain their own views out the main repo, and we can get Skiasharp back updated again.",
