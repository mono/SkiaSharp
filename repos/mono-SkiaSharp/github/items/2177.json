        "body": "Disclaimer:\r\n\r\nThis answer solved my problem with QuestPDF. Maby it\u0027s different for SkiaSharp only.\r\n\r\nI solved the error. If you want SkiaSharp to work with Unity you need to do the following:\r\n\r\n1. Download NuGetForUnity and install it in your project.\r\n2. Install SkiaSharp from the list.\r\n3. Remove these 2 folders inside the SkiaSharp package folder\r\n\r\n- buildTransitive\r\n- interactive-extensions\r\n\r\n4. Then you need to install libskiasharp and libharfbuzzsharp from NuGet these are the versions where I could find the lib dll\r\n\r\n- libskiasharp is version 2.80.3\r\n- harfbuzzsharp is version 2.6.1.9\r\n\r\nHope this helps!",
