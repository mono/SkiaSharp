  "body": "Hi, First of all, thank you so much for your hard work. The project is awesome. \r\n\r\nI was able to resize my image to a specific WidthXHeight, but I am wondering if there is a way to scale it down to specific MB size. For example, if an image is over 5MB scale it down to 5MB. What I\u0027ve tried was to scale an image down by width %. So, I would take current MB size, see what percentage of it is 5MB, and then change the pixel width by that percentage. It works, but for example, for 25MB image it gives me an image of 3.5MB. What I am worried about, is an image that is 100MB, will not come down to under 4MB. \r\n\r\nI also **don\u0027t** want to resize it multiple times. For example, resize once, check if under 5MB, if not resize again. \r\n\r\nDo you have any ideas on how I could approach this problem?\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nHubert\r\n",
