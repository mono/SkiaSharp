  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nwe use a custom MapControl for Zooming and Panning it\u0027s Content. It contains a SKCanvasView inside, which draws a SKPicture vector graphic. When the user zooms in, the MapControl increases the scale property of the SKCanvasView and the drawn Picture becomes bigger as expected. The Problem is that the Picture is pixelated although it should be scalable without pixelation as it\u0027s a vector graphic. I can provide Code or a sample solution if needed.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your help!",
