  "title": "[FEATURE] Variable fonts support, shaping with opentype features opt-in",
  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nWe are developing a windows .net app that is required to provide some typographical features to the user. Current version of SkiaSharp does not expose some of the API available in native skia and harfbuzz that allows to achieve things like opentype features (e.g. kerning, ligatures) or setting design coords of variable font axis.\r\nCurrently we are working around some of these limitations by PInvoking functions from libSkiaSharp and libHarfBuzzSharp but it becomes more and more clunky I feel. Also worth mentioning is that this needs to be supported for ad hoc uploaded font files, for which the support in SkiaSharp is even more limited, as you can\u0027t really use SkFontManager for these as it only handles system fonts. (or can you but I didn\u0027t find how?)\r\n\r\nAlso if there is actually some other way to achieve what I am trying to do - please point me that way :)\r\nI\u0027m also more than eager to contribute, the problem is I really have a hard time getting everything built locally, not mentioning to run tests for various platforms. I was not able to get the whole skiasharp to build correctly, I managed to get  libSkiaSharp built which allowed me to expose some of the API I was missing.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you\u0027d like**\r\n\r\nFor much better experience with typography in SkiaSharp I\u0027d like to expose following API:\r\n\r\n1. SkShaper.Shape should get \u0060Feature[] features\u0060 parameter which would enable easy access to features like \u0027liga\u0027 or \u0027kern\u0027 (and tens more available in open type fonts)\r\n2. Harfbuzz Font: hb_font_set_var_coords_design, hb_font_set_var_named_instance should be exposed to allow proper shaping of variable fonts.\r\n3. SkTypeFace: \r\n\r\n- getVariationDesignParameters, getVariationDesignPosition - get info about variable coords\r\n[update] Actually hb_ot_var_named_instance_get_design_coords and hb_ot_var_get_axis_infos gioves more complete info....\r\n\r\n- makeClone - enables setting coords of font face variable axis\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you\u0027ve considered**\r\n\r\nThere is not really a good alternative at the moment. At least that I\u0027m not aware of. SkiaSharp is a fantastic library and I hesitate from using anything more. There is just a lot of useful api still not exposed.\r\nThe current workarounds I did to get above things working:\r\nAd. 1. Implemented SkShaperFeatured which is basically source copy of SkShaper, but has features parameter enabled.\r\nAd. 2. PInvoking to already available libHarfbuzz extern functions.\r\nAd. 3. Had to expose extern static funcs to above api and rebuild libSkiasharp. I didn\u0027t succeed getting SkiaSharp nuget built, but that\u0027s work in progress, so I\u0027m PInvoking to these functions at the moment. This requires maintaining a fork though.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nAd. 1\r\nI was able to render all kinds of featured type faces with the workarounds (example of Calibri below)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2964157/202856095-cf15c753-747e-44f2-b3ad-7fe0380674ff.png)\r\n\r\nAd. 2/3\r\nI\u0027m currently testing the workarounds, with mostly successes, but I do not have a screenshot to share.\r\n\r\n",
