How can I achieve this with SkiaSharp.\r\n\r\nI tried to check \u0060SKbitmap.ColorSpace\u0060, but is is always null.\r\nThen I tried to use \u0060SKCodec.ColorSpace\u0060, it is initialized, but even for CMYK \u0060SKCodec.ColorSpace.Type\u0060 images it returns \u0060SKColorSpaceType.Rgb\u0060. \r\n\r\nIs there a way to to detect CYMK images with SkiaSharp?\r\n",
