Please describe.**\r\n\r\nRight now, both SkiaSharp.Views.Forms and SkiaSharp.Views.Maui only support using OpenGL in the \u0060SKGLView\u0060 since this was the only backend at the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you\u0027d like**\r\n\r\nTime has moved on and we need a GPU view that swaps out the backend controls based on the preferred backend for each platform.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you\u0027ve considered**\r\n\r\nThe only alternative now is to create a new renderer and copy the code from this repo.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n\u003C!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. --\u003E\r\n",
