        "body": "**Closing as not affected** \u2014 SkiaSharp does not use MiniZip.\n\nCVE-2023-45853 affects the **MiniZip** component (\u0060contrib/minizip/\u0060) bundled with zlib, not core zlib itself. SkiaSharp/Skia does not compile or link MiniZip.\n\n**Evidence:**\n\n1. Skia\u0027s \u0060third_party/zlib/BUILD.gn\u0060 only includes core zlib files (adler32.c, compress.c, deflate.c, etc.) \u2014 no \u0060contrib/minizip/\u0060 sources\n2. No MiniZip headers (\u0060unzip.h\u0060, \u0060zip.h\u0060) are included anywhere in Skia\n3. No MiniZip functions (\u0060unzOpen\u0060, \u0060zipOpen\u0060, etc.) are called\n\nCore zlib (deflate/inflate) **is** used by SkiaSharp for PDF compression and PNG support, but those functions are unaffected by this CVE.\n\nIf your security scanner flags this, it\u0027s a false positive \u2014 you can safely exclude it.",
