However, are you able to see if you can attach the handler using effects: https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/effects/introduction/\r\n\r\nYou can do that and just add the effect for Android - no need to create a custom renderer. You can access the native control and even cast it to \u0060SKCanvasView\u0060",

I was going to do a bit more, but there are a few things that need thought. So, I decided to just allow for customizations on to of what\u0027s there for the first release.\r\n\r\nI am closing this issue as my commit actually adresses the feature, and other changes should be on a new issue",
