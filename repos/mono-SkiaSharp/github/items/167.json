  "title": "SkiaSharp Views - Touch Events",
  "body": "With Xamarin Forms, we can hook into 3 built-in Gesture Recognizers: Pan, Pinch, and Tap. Pan and Pinch are working wonderfully, but unfortunately the Tap gesture does not return X and Y coordinates of the touch, which renders it basically useless for anything Skia-related. Would it be possible to create a custom touch event in the new SkiaSharp Views that would return X and Y coordinates back to the Xamarin Forms code? Or perhaps there\u0027s a way to extend these new views and do that our self?\n\nThanks,\nRobert\n",
