  "body": "Using an old version of SkiaSharp v1.60 here... I want to create a new SKTypeface from an existing one but with a different Style. The code \u0060SKTypeface.FromTypeface\u0060 worked just fine in Windows but sadly, it fails on macOS and Linux. Analyzing the new version of SkiaSharp, I see that method is now also obsolete. The only way I can see to create a new SKTypeface with a new style from an existing one is through the \u0060SKTypeface.FromFamilyName\u0060 but the problem here is that the SKTypeface we want to \u0022copy\u0022 with a new Style is loaded through \u0060SKTypeface.FromStream\u0060 instead\r\n\r\nSo, is there any way to create a new SKTypeface from an existing one with a different style?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance ",
