  "body": "**Description**\r\n\r\nWhen encoding an image you can get some pretty bad results on the red channel. It seems like the color calculations are wrong. While these results can be expected in these formats on low qualities (you get similar effects on 40% on JPEG in photoshop) these are here even on 100%. \r\n\r\n![encoding_red](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2620599/187592969-61986bf9-9881-4322-ae96-fe3d21e18f6f.jpg)\r\n\r\nAnother example, once again PNG encoding has no issues so it cannot be a decoding issue?\r\n\r\n![shapes2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2620599/187595995-62a61714-c3d4-4a07-afda-e3765769fd33.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Basic Information**\r\n\r\n- Version with issue:  2.80.2, 2.88.1\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal image:\r\n![shapes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2620599/187597928-4c954101-fe60-4b13-9873-37306fbf8aa7.jpg)\r\n![shapes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2620599/187593549-a76ab7d3-14fb-46cd-8c08-5176cf7fd850.png)\r\n",
