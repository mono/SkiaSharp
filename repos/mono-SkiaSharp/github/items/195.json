  "title": "Incorrect GetHashCode implementation for bindings with float/double",
  "body": "For the binding definition of \u0060SKSize\u0060, \u0060GetHashCode\u0060 is defined as \r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\tpublic override int GetHashCode ()\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\treturn (int) width ^ (int) height;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\nHowever, this is incorrect. \u0060Size(10, 10)\u0060 and \u0060Size(10.99, 10.99)\u0060 will provide the same hash code in this instance.\r\n\r\nI have a PR ready, but I presume, this bug also will remain across the definitions. Will probably give it a glance to see if more changes are required with other binding that accept float/double before submitting.",
