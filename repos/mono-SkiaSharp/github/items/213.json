        "body": "@tdenniston This can be done in two ways. \u0060CreateDefaultInterface\u0060 uses the preferred platform engine - on Windows it is DirectX. I haven\u0027t yet got the targets in place for it to work out the box.\r\n\r\n\u0060CreateDefaultInterface\u0060 is basically a wrapper: \u0060CreateNativeAngleInterface() ?? CreateNativeGlInterface()\u0060. On non-Windows platforms \u0060CreateNativeAngleInterface\u0060 just returns null, so automatically falls back to OpenGL[ES].\r\n\r\nHowever, OpenGL is working fine: \u0060GRGlInterface.CreateNativeGlInterface()\u0060. This will work on Windows 7 out the box and is what I use for the GL controls. I need to get the ANGLE bits for Windows Classic and then hook up the DirectX/OpenGL context to WinForms. This is a bit of work, so I haven\u0027t had a chance to do it yet.",
