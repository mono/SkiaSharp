  "body": "Hello @mattleibow!\r\n\r\nAre you aware of any code or samples that leverage a virtual canvas with SkiaSharp?  The use case we\u0027re trying to solve is something like the following:\r\n\r\n- Looking to draw a large amount of graphics on top of a Map viewport.\r\n- Would like to create a canvas that is much larger than the visible viewport without creating a \u0027real\u0027 canvas that size.\r\n- As the map viewport is panned/zoomed, we want to pan/zoom the virtual canvas to that visible position, triggering a render of the canvas\u0027s visible viewport on top of the map control.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
