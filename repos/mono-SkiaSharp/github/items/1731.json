  "title": "[QUESTION] SkiaSharp vs System.Windows.Media.FormattedText",
  "body": "Hello Guys,\r\n\r\nI am planning on moving an App from WPF to Xamarin, and I want to use SkiaSharp to accomplish a task that it is currently capable of.\r\n\r\nThis App generates a text based on TrueType fonts, after generating and presenting it to the screen, it sends commands to a device similar to a \u00223d printer\u0022 that engraves this text. And for doing that it reads all the glyphs inside the generated text based on the top left origin, and generates the g codes (movement codes) for the machine to write physically the text.\r\n\r\nI am currently stuck on the FormattedText class to accomplish that, using the BuildGeometry method that returns a Geometry which has PathGeometry, PathFigure, with LineSegments, PolyBezierSegments and others, representing the build path for the font.\r\n\r\nI just want your help to kindly advice if the SkiaSharp has all these details (or have something similar to that). I have already seen a class called SKPaint that has a MeasureText method, and some methods like GetGlyphs and GetGlyphsPosition that seems to help on that journey. But I don\u0027t see exactly the lines, beziercurves, etc. Could you please advice about it?\r\n\r\nThanks for your help,\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n",
