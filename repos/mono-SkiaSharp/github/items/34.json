  "title": "Support for SkRegion in the future?",
  "body": "I would love to see support for SkRegion, plus more exposure of SkPath. In particular, I\u0027m interested in being able to create an SKRegion from and SkPath, do operations on SkRegion such as intersect, union, subtract, containment, and get the bounary of an SkRegion as an SkPath. Finally, being able to enumerate an SkPath to get all of its components.\n\nAll of this is supported in the Skia C\u002B\u002B library; it would be really nice to use this from C#. \n\nAll of these operations can be useful in a 2D application even apart from drawing.\n",
