I join the sample image too.\r\n\r\nIf you have any idea to solve this issue, your welcome :-)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17200971/130828780-2697377c-a0a4-4d28-949d-056a07279593.png)\r\n\r\n**Here is my code (very basic):**\r\n**\r\nResultBitmap = SKBitmap.Decode(stream);\r\n\r\nprotected override void OnPaintSurface(SKPaintSurfaceEventArgs e)\r\n{\r\n    SKPaint paint = new SKPaint();\r\n    surface.Canvas.DrawBitmap(ResultBitmap , rect, paint: paint);\r\n}\r\n**\r\n\r\nAnd the sample image:\r\n![dog](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17200971/130829309-30d0ef6e-1ba8-40e2-a69a-f795ea75139c.jpg)",
