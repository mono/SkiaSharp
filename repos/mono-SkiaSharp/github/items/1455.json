  "title": "[FEATURE] Mobile Blazor Bindings",
  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nI\u0027d like to use SkiaSharp in my Mobile Blazor Bindings apps. I\u0027m happy to write the code and open a PR to make this happen.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you\u0027d like**\r\n\r\nI propose a nuget called SkiaSharp.Views.MobileBlazorBindings which exposes the features of SkiaSharp.Views.Forms in a wrapper that fits nicely in a Mobile Blazor Bindings app. \r\n\r\nThis would be a .NET Standard library that depends on the SkiaSharp.View.Forms project and has a Nuget dependency on Microsoft.MobileBlazorBindings.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you\u0027ve considered**\r\n\r\nI can see a few ways to get SkiaSharp working in a Mobile Blazor Bindings App:\r\n1. Users write their own wrapper inside their apps \u2013 I\u0027ve already got this working but we don\u0027t want everyone to write this code every time.\r\n2. We make a SkiaSharp.Views.MobileBlazorBindings nuget that lives in the SkiaSharp repository.\r\n3. We make a MobileBlazorBindings.Views.SkiaSharp library that lives in the Mobile Blazor Bindings Repo  \r\n4. I make an unofficial Lachlan.SkiaSharpMobileBlazor nuget\r\n5. Some cool generic wrapper type thing being added to Mobile Blazor Bindings that makes using XF controls easier.\r\n\r\nI think option 2 (putting it in SkiaSharp repo) makes the most sense because it follows the established pattern of how SkiaSharp is released for other frameworks and it would make sense to tie it to the SkiaSharp.Views.Forms release cycle.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nMobile Blazor Bindings is still experimental so we don\u0027t really know when/how the project might evolve. It may be that in the future this library would stop making sense or would need a name change.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the project would be very similar to [this wrapping of PancakeView](https://github.com/xamarin/MobileBlazorBindings/tree/master/samples/MobileBlazorBindingsWeather/Microsoft.MobileBlazorBindings.PancakeView).\r\n\r\nEilon Lipton who runs the Mobile Blazor Bindings project probably has some thoughts about whether this approach makes sense. He may have a different approach in mind for wrapping up components. He\u0027s not @ taggable here but I\u0027ll send him a link. MBB Issues [79](https://github.com/xamarin/MobileBlazorBindings/issues/79), [25](https://github.com/xamarin/MobileBlazorBindings/issues/25) and PR [61](https://github.com/xamarin/MobileBlazorBindings/pull/61) seem relevant.\r\n\r\nI\u0027m currently having trouble building SkiaSharp which I\u0027ve [posted a separate issue for](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/issues/1454), once I\u0027m up and running this shouldn\u0027t take long. \r\n\r\n**Proposed API**\r\nUsing a Canvas View would look something like this. Other than how the SKCanvasView is added to the UI, no other changes would be necessary outside of the exisitng SkiaSharp.Views.Forms package.\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060razor\r\n\u003CContentPage\u003E\r\n    \u003CStackLayout\u003E\r\n        \u003CSKCanvasView InvalidateSurface=\u0022@PaintSurface\u0022\u003E\u003C/SKCanvasView\u003E\r\n    \u003C/StackLayout\u003E\r\n\u003C/ContentPage\u003E\r\n\r\n@code \r\n{ \r\n\r\n    void PaintSurface (object sender, SkiaSharp.Views.Forms.SKPaintSurfaceEventArgs e)\r\n    {\r\n        var surface = e.Surface;\r\n        var canvas = surface.Canvas;\r\n        canvas.Clear(SkiaSharp.SKColor.Parse(\u0022#CC0000\u0022));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060",
