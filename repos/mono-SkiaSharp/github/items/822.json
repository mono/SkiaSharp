  "title": "How to do fling using the touch events",
  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nUsing the SkiaSharp.Views.Forms SKGLView, how would I measure fling using the touch events in iOS and Android? The native platforms come with implementations of gesture recognizers. Which do velocity tracking etc for fling. This is for the Mapsui mapping library which uses skia for rendering.\r\n\r\nI was able to make the android one work by re converting the touch events back into a native version in a renderer and use the platforms gesture recognizer (which feels dirty but works) but the same isn\u0027t possible for iOS. When I add the gesture recognizer to the native view it overrides the touches within the SKGLView.\r\n\r\nMaybe adding some gestures to the SKGLView and SKCanvasView would be enable more people to utilize the skia views in forms easily? I.e. single tap, double tap, long tap, fling with x/y velocity etc.\r\n\r\nCheers",
