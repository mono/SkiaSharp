        "body": "Hi again @Goldstrike, SkiaSharp is not really a editor so probably the answer is no. However, SkiaSharp can be used as the actual visualization/drawing engine. \n\nBasically, you will have to write the logic to handle the draw, create and resizing of shapes via touch/mouse. Then SkiaSharp can do the simple drawing. Think of SkiaSharp as the \u0060canvas.DrawRect(x, y, w, h);\u0060 bit - it draws a rectangle, but you will still have to do the work to translate swipes into a drag/resize operation.\n",
