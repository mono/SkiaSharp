  "title": "large apk size with xamarin C9",
  "body": "This might purely be a C9 related issue, or it might be some interaction with how skiasharp is built. But the APK size is much larger with C9 with skiasharp than it was with C8. Looking at the APK the skiasharp assembly DLL is 9mb which i assume includes the embedded native library,.  So is the native part is included in the APK twice?",

And what are you using VS on Windows or XS on macOS? Is this a Debug/Release build?",

I am closing this as this in not directly related to the SkiaSharp project.\r\n\r\nI have opened an issue with the Android team: https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53250\r\n\r\nAt this time, I am unaware of a workaround, so rolling back to the latest C8 release appears to be the  only option. However, hopefully that team can help with a workaround, or at least a solution very soon.",
