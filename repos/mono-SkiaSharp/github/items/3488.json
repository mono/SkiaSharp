  "body": "This pull request makes significant improvements to the SkiaSharp contribution workflow documentation, focusing on clearer compliance requirements, more robust build and test instructions, and better separation of workflows for adding APIs and fixing bugs. It introduces stricter branch protection guidance, mandates native builds after C API changes, and updates troubleshooting steps to prevent common errors. Additionally, it adds a dedicated skill file for bug fixes and removes the old \u0060implement-issue\u0060 workflow, streamlining and clarifying the process for contributors.\r\n\r\n**Branch protection and compliance:**\r\n\r\n* Added explicit branch protection instructions to \u0060.github/skills/add-api/SKILL.md\u0060 and \u0060.github/skills/bug-fix/SKILL.md\u0060, requiring feature branches for both parent and submodule repositories before making any changes.

Troubleshooting documentation now emphasizes that \u0060EntryPointNotFoundException\u0060 is caused by missing native builds.
