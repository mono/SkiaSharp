  "title": "[FEATURE] Support webassembly using CanvasKit",
  "body": "I\u0027m using SkiaSharp now with great success in my Xamarin Forms application.\r\nI would like to dip into Blazor for the same project so I also need a Canvas-like control. While i probably could use javascript interops to the html canvas, it would be great to also have Skia here.\r\nI\u0027ve recently seen that Skia already supports webassembly, see link: [skia canvaskit](https://skia.org/user/modules/canvaskit\r\n)\r\nWould it be hard to use this to have a SkiaSharp.Web implementation?\r\n\r\nKind regards\n\n\u003E VS bug [#770225](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/770225)",

If the idea is to expose an API that simplifies this, skia might not be as performant as an specific canvas 2d api wrapper.\r\nEach solution has benefits and drawbacks, so the users themselves should be able to pick whatever fits their needs.\r\nI don\u0027t have previous experience with Skia API so I\u0027m not sure how much performance may be lost from adapting from one API (skia) to the other (canvas? webgl?).
