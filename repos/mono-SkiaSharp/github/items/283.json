I thought Korean was part of the RTL issue, but it appears that it was just a typeface issue. \r\n\r\nI think the default typefaces do not actually have any Korean characters, thus it will draw blocks. The correct way to find a typeface on the device is to use the \u0060SKFontManager\u0060:\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060csharp\r\n// find a typeface that has the characters\r\nvar tf = SKFontManager.Default.MatchCharacter(\u0027\uD5EC\u0027);\r\n\r\n// create a paint\r\nvar paint = new SKPaint { Typeface = tf };\r\n\r\n// draw the text\r\ncanvas.DrawText(\u0022\uD5EC\uB85C\uC6B0 \uC6D4\uB4DC\u0022, ...);\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060",
