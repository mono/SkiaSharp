  "body": "**Description of Change**\r\n\r\nThere is no OpenGL or OpenGL ES on Mac Catalyst - there technically _is_ but it is not meant to be used - so we swap out the backend of the .NET MAUI \u0060SKGLView\u0060 to rather be a \u0060SKMetalView\u0060 on Mac Catalyst.\r\n\r\nThere needs to be a new GPU view that uses Metal on Apple and maybe Vulkan on Android. But that is for another PR. We need an interface so people can even swap out their preferred backend. https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/issues/2104",
