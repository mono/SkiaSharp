  "body": "Hi @mattleibow , I\u0027m really excited to try the new views stuff. Unfortunately when I try to load up the FormsSample on windows with my iOS device connected it fails to restore the iOS portions of the nuget properly. There exists no MonoTouch10 or Xamarin.iOS10 lib folders like there are for Xamarin.Forms.2.3.0.49. Perhaps your Nuspec has a problem? \n\nHere\u0027s a screenshot of the package contents:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/554363/19336088/5b9cabda-90bd-11e6-8354-fe28dbd8e928.png)\n\nWhere\u0027s Xamarin.Forms looks like this:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/554363/19336104/8931fbea-90bd-11e6-994c-ff60765addef.png)\n",

        "body": "Thanks for reporting the issue. I am closing this as we have \u0022resolved\u0022 it. The problem was the fact that when building the code from the repo, the NuGets are installed from the output directory. This installation results in the build being cached in the NuGet cache.\n\nTo resolve, delete these folders:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\nC:\\Users\\\u003Cusername\u003E\\.nuget\\packages\\SkiaSharp\\\nC:\\Users\\\u003Cusername\u003E\\.nuget\\packages\\SkiaSharp.Views\\\nC:\\Users\\\u003Cusername\u003E\\.nuget\\packages\\SkiaSharp.Views.Forms\\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThis will force a download from nuget.org\n",
