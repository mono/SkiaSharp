  "body": "Hi, \r\n\r\nWhen I press right button and move I do canvas translation.\r\nWhen I scroll up/down I do canvas scale.\r\n\r\nElements placed on the canvas have fixed position (on the video we have images but it can be any type of shapes (rectangles, circles, lines, paths etc.)).\r\n\r\n[sample video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C59gB0GyxhJIFsDanSvtncdIY_Irqg7n/view)\r\n\r\nIs there a way to translate/scale canvas without invalidating surface ?\r\nCurrently, each time when mouse move is handled, the surface is invalidated and I need to re-draw whole elements. Performance suffers according to number of elements on the canvas.\r\n\r\nI would be glad for any suggestions how to improve it. ",
