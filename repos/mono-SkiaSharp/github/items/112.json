        "body": "@migueldeicaza In this case, @bholmes is right because \u0060SKObject\u0060 does not have the unref. This is because not all \u0060SKObject\u0060s are \u0060SKRefCnt\u0060 objects. An example would be \u0060SKBitmap\u0060/\u0060SKPaint\u0060, which is just a plain object and the destructor is used.\n\nI think there are just those two variants, so I could create another type that uses the unref and the base uses the destructor, but for simplicity\u0027s sake, I just unref in the dispose methods. So, in this case, I forgot to add the unref, which I have added now.\n",
