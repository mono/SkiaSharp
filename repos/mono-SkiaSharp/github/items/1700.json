  "title": "[FEATURE] HEIF decoder and encoder  ",
  "body": "Since iPhone 11 the default image format for pictures taken is HEIF (HEIC), not JPEG anymore (unless the user changes the \u0027compatibility setting\u0027 in the camera settings). For my app this is a blocker, as no picture can be decoded. \r\n\r\nI wish the SkiaSharp had built-in support for HEIF, so that I could decode and encode SKBitmap directly. \r\n\r\n\u003C!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you\u0027ve considered. --\u003E\r\nI\u0027ve tried to add support for HEIF decoding using external libs (I\u0027ve tried ImageMagick), but it appears that bindings are for this library available only for Windows and Mac (but not iOS, Android).  (Project Magick.NET).\r\nEven If .Net bindings were available for these platforms, I would still need to use extra library, and apply conversion between formats (from SkiaBitmap to ImageMagick and back). \r\n\r\nHEIF/HEIC support is inevitable, as more and more software will use it. But even if not, the sole Apple move towards HEIF is in my humble opinion enough to consider expediting the support.    ",
