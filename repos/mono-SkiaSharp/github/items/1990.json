        "body": "A few years later i came across the same problem. \nWhen running through COM it appears Skiasharp looks for a specific version of System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe.dll, \nnamely AssemblyVersion 4.0.4.1 (Which is Package Version 4.5.3). Although we are at Package Version 6.0.0 every else. \n\nSo i downloaded the package with that version from: https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe/4.5.3\nrenamed it to zip and extracted the dll to a different folder.\nOn the particular machine where the issue occured i installed Windows SDK to get the GacUtil.\nThen simply register the dll with \u0022gacutil.exe /i\u0022 and the issue disappeard.\n\nMaybe this helps someone until the issue is fixed.",
