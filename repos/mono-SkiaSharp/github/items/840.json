        "body": "To put it into some perspective: it seems that no matter what kind of paths you send into the operations, it always comes out in even-odd. This is the function that they added to fix it if you need it in non-zero (winding). Without the function, you simply can\u0027t work in non-zero mode at all because you can input but you can\u0027t use the output at all. And a rather large part of the world (SVG, fonts, PostScript, PDF and so on) uses the non-zero mode; I\u0027d venture to say *most*.",

        "body": "It is totally fine to start with all the Windows dependencies and add other platforms later. The build chain to compile everything is part of the repo so you only have to supply all dependencies that are needed to build for your target platform. On Windows this is mainly msbuild (VisualStudio).\r\n\r\nThe moment you create a pull request you can use DevOps to build for all platforms.\r\n\r\nI am contributing to SkiaSharp myself and haven\u0027t had any issues building everything I need. This is all done in my free time.\r\n\r\nThe community can help bringing this project further.\r\n\r\nIt is not trivial to update Skia to a newer version because the code base changes a lot. There is no guarantee for backward compatibility. \r\n\r\nSkia itself has no C API that we need for P/Invoke so we have to wrap everything with custom code. So it is not just pulling latest master and press build. ",
