  "body": "## Summary\n\nUpgrades the triage skill schema from v2.0 to v2.1 with mandatory code investigation requirements.\n\n### Changes\n\n- **Schema v2.1**: Add \u0060codeInvestigation\u0060 array to \u0060analysis\u0060 (required, min 1 entry)\n  - Each entry: \u0060{file, lines, relevance}\u0060 \u2014 source code signals with file:line citations\n  - \u0060close-*\u0060 actions require \u22652 code investigation signals\n  - Dismissing relevance as \u0060unlikely\u0060 requires \u22651 code signal\n- **SKILL.md**: Make code investigation mandatory in Phase 2 (before classification)\n- **Anti-pattern rules**: No pre-baked delegation, no age-based closure, no assertion without citation, no platform-deprecated=stale assumption\n- **Examples**: Updated all 3 triage examples (bug, question, duplicate) with \u0060codeInvestigation\u0060 entries\n- **Schema version**: Bumped from \u00602.0\u0060 to \u00602.1\u0060\n\n### Motivation\n\nCode investigation was optional in v2.0, leading to triage outputs that made claims about code behavior without verifying against actual source. This caused incorrect classifications and missed fixes. v2.1 enforces citation-backed analysis.\n\n### Validation\n\nTested by retriaging the 11 oldest open issues (#209, #243, #310, #315, #425, #528, #533, #552, #576, #607, #911). All 11 triages pass schema v2.1 validation and were cross-checked by Gemini 3 Pro \u2014 11/11 received \u2705 across all review dimensions (classification, code investigation, suggested action, resolution, tone).",
