  "body": "I am trying to run the units tests in the \u0060dev/update-skia\u0060 branch, so I can continue working on PRs, but my \u0060dotnet test\u0060 run always fails randomly, with native exceptions (access violations). Sometimes a dozens of tests succeed before crashing, sometimes upto abour 100, so this smells like a multi threading issues. I have 32 hyperthreads (AMD 3950x) all running at the same time, so this might reveal race conditions.\r\n\r\nIs this a known issue? \r\n\r\nI have build both the native and managed code successfully, on Windows 10, using the latest version of VS2019.\r\n",
