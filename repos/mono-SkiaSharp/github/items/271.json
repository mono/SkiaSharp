        "body": "@PatrickRyder \r\n\r\nNo waste of time.\r\n\r\nIs this an actual build warning? I wasn\u0027t able to get a warning in the MSBuild results, but this was just visible in the build log. And, this is a warning from Xcode\u0027s dsymutil tool. If you set the options in Xcode to strip release builds (a yes/no option) then you will also get this warning.\r\n\r\nMay this helps with any arguments :)",
