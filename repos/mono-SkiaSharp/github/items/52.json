Now hitting different problems with compilation. \n",

        "body": "Hey @tdenniston, and anyone else having the same problem, SkiaSharp uses its own branch of Skia which you\u0027d have to pull/download. Navigate to this repo\u0027s Skia folder and pull from it. Not sure how to do it from git bash though. You\u0027d also need Google\u0027s depot tool to compile. \n",

        "body": "Thanks @ariste1a. I can\u0027t seem to identify an actual branch of Skia that SkiaSharp uses, but I managed to fix my compile error with the following steps:\n- Open the mono/SkiaSharp master branch on Github.\n- The \u0027skia\u0027 directory is displayed as something like \u0027skia @ 15d4e8e\u0027. Take note of the commit hash after the @ sign.\n- In Git bash navigate to the \u0027skia\u0027 directory on your filesystem. Execute \u0027git checkout 15d4e8e\u0027.\n- Try rebuilding SkiaSharp.\n\nThis fixed this particular compile error for me. Hopefully one of the maintainers can comment on why this was necessary.\n",
