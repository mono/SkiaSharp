The v1.60.0 does have the raster-based widget \u0060SKWidget\u0060 already in the package.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I need to consider is the GPU-based view. I see I need to use a newer version of OpenTK that is not available on NuGet, and at the same time, there is an OpenTK bundled in Xamarin.Forms.\r\n\r\nSo far I have not really looked into this, but what I might do is not provide a GPU-based widget for the platform package (at least not yet), and then base the Forms \u0060SKGLView\u0060 off the existing OpenGL view in Xamarin.Forms.",
