  "title": "[BUG] Rendering a SKXamlCanvas on Android together with AcrylicBrush looks weird",
  "body": "**Description**\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this is a duplicate issue - the original one is posted on the [Uno-Repo here](https://github.com/unoplatform/uno/issues/7255).\r\n\r\nI\u0027m not exactly sure, why and where my error comes from. The linked issue also links to a [sample repo](https://github.com/TopperDEL/UnoAcrylicBrushSkiaError). Basically it works on UWP but brings weird results on Android (did not test iOs yet) where the image seems to be smaller/with wrong proportions below the AcrylicBrush.\r\n\r\nAny help greatly appreciated! This is currently the last issue blocking me from releasing an app to the public.\r\n\r\n**Basic Information**\r\n\r\n- Version with issue:  SkiaSharp 2.80.2 and SkiaSharp.View.Uno 2.80.3\r\n- IDE:  VS 2022\r\n- Platform Target Frameworks: \u003C!-- all that apply, remove the platforms that aren\u0027t broken or haven\u0027t had any testing --\u003E\r\n  - Android: 11.0 \r\n- Target Devices:   \r\n  - Huawei P30 Pro\r\n  \r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\nVideo is in the linked issue: https://github.com/unoplatform/uno/issues/7255\r\n\r\n**Reproduction Link**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/TopperDEL/UnoAcrylicBrushSkiaError\r\n\r\n",
