  "title": "[FEATURE] Metal support for tvOS",
  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nCurrently, Metal seems to be only supported on iOS and macOS. This appears to just be because the code was pretty much just written like that and no actual technical limitation.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you\u0027d like**\r\n\r\nAdding the APIs from this issue https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/issues/1391 and this PR https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/pull/1394, but for tvOS.\r\nSince some changes are needed to native skia, I opened this: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/skia/issues/detail?id=11250\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you\u0027ve considered**\r\n\r\nThere are no other alternatives :)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nI gave it a quick stab, but it seems to be a few more lines of if\u0027s and else\u0027s and ios -\u003E tvos things. Looks to be names-only as the feature set is pretty close.\r\n",
