  "body": "Currently SkiaSharp doesn\u0027t always throw exceptions, it maps closely to the native Skia library.\r\n\r\nIf that behavior is desired, it would be nice to annotate all possible null return values using C#\u0027s nullable reference type feature.\r\n\r\nLike this the user would get warnings when de-referencing potential null objects.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
