  "body": "Currently SkiaSharp doesn\u0027t always throw exceptions, it maps closely to the native Skia library.\r\n\r\nIf that behavior is desired, it would be nice to annotate all possible null return values using C#\u0027s nullable reference type feature.\r\n\r\nLike this the user would get warnings when de-referencing potential null objects.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I am looking at doing this sometime soon-ish.\r\n\r\nNot sure if a partial rollout will be more confusing, but this library is large enough for me to say that I am sure that some things may be missed or wrong. Hopefully, folks in the community could help out with some PRs just to annotate members/types.\r\n",
