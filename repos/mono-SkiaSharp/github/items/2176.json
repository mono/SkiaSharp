  "title": "[QUESTION] SkElement or skiaSharp is not working in some windows PC\u0027s",
  "body": "We used skia in our project to draw lines on . a bitmap based on user Input(at runtime). We then used the timer to trigger skElement PaintSurface Event( by calling InvalidateVisual() API). In the PaintSurface Event handler, we draw the skBitmap on the canvas.\r\n\r\nThis approach is working for most of the windows users. But only a couple of customer this approach is not working. \r\nWe tried to look for any settings change but couldn\u0027t find any.\r\n\r\nWe tried below skia\u0027s sample project which updates the frame number. This example project working fine for us i.e, we could see the frame number keeps increasing. This sample project also is not working for our customers. The frame number stops with number 1 and is not updating further.\r\nhttps://lostindetails.com/articles/skiasharp-with-wpf\r\n\r\nCould you please help us to understand why above solution is not working in some PC\u0027s please?\r\nPlease let us know if you are in need of more information.\r\n\r\nThanks",

I tested the program on my laptop and found that using Invalidate Visual cannot re render, but changing the window size can be done.\r\nWhen I test on a desktop computer, he can trigger a re rendering using InvalidateVisual\r\nNotebook is i5-1135G7, XE gpu, without independent graphics card\r\nDesktop has a separate graphics card",
