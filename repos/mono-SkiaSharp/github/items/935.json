  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nI need to get the glyph path for a specific glyph id, not for a string.\r\nThe SkFont in skia has the getPath method.\r\nSkiaSharp is missing the SKFont class and bindings though.\r\nhttps://skia.org/user/api/SkFont_Reference#SkFont_getPath\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you\u0027d like**\r\nPlease add a wrapper for SkFont.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you\u0027ve considered**\r\nI used the GetTextPath method from SKPaint. But when I shape with HarfBuzz, the codepoints differ for ligature texts (e.g. tt gets converted to one glyph for two characters).\r\nI have no possibility to get the correct glyph path for this glyph id.\r\nThe glyp id I get from HarfBuzz.\r\nIs there any way to use this glyph id elsewhere?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for all the work to the team! Great work!",
