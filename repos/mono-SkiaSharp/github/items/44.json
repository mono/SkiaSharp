I am just preparing to release the next version, but maybe I can fit this in:\r\n\r\nHow does adding a MSBuild property in the csproj sound? So, we can still target AnyCPU, but if there is something like this:\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060xml\r\n\u003COverrideSkiaSharpPlatform\u003Ex86\u003C/OverrideSkiaSharpPlatform\u003E\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\nthen, instead of copying both platforms to the output location, it just pretends it is an x86 app?",
