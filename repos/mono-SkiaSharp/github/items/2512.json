  "title": "[FEATURE] Add function to \u0060SkiaSharp.Harfbuzz\u0060 for getting shaped text paths",
  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\n\u003C!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I need to do X, but the API is missing from the C# binding. --\u003E\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is no shaped equivalent to \u0060SKPaint.GetTextPath()\u0060, which can be inconvenient in scenarios that utilize \u0060CanvasExtensions.DrawShapedText()\u0060 and require drawing an outline around the text.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you\u0027d like**\r\n\r\n\u003C!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. --\u003E\r\n\r\nAn extension method for \u0060SKFont\u0060 that returns the shaped path of a text input. To remain consistent with \u0060CanvasExtensions.DrawShapedText()\u0060, the primary method signature would ideally be along the lines of:\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060cs\r\nSKPath GetShapedTextPath(this SKFont paint, SKShaper shaper, string text, float x, float y, SKTextAlign textAlign)\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you\u0027ve considered**\r\n\r\n\u003C!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you\u0027ve considered. --\u003E\r\n\r\nThis functionality could just be implemented within my own projects, however I believe it would benefit the community if it were included within \u0060SkiaSharp.Harfbuzz\u0060.\r\n",
