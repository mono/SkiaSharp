  "title": "Unable to create 8 bit image",
  "body": "I\u0027m working on a simple scenario of creating a filled rectangle, opening a png file and placing it on top of the rectangle and then saving the image as a png. This works, but I am unable to get the outputted file to have a bit depth of 8. It is currently at 32 bits.\r\n\r\nI have tried creating an 8 bit SKSurface by setting the SKColorType to Index8 and Alpha8. With Index8 I get null for the surface. With Alpha8 the surface is created, but surface.Snapshot().Encode() returns null.\r\n\r\nAlso, I am reading in the png file using SKBitmap.Decode(filePath). This results in a SKBitmap with a ColorType of SkiaSharp.SKColorType.Bgra8888.\r\n\r\nHow can I get an 8 bit output image in this scenario? Thanks.",
