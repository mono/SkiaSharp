  "body": "\u003C!--\r\n\r\nYou can ask questions here, but there might be better places to do that as well:\r\n\r\n - If you have questions on how to use SkiaSharp with .NET, this is the best place.\r\n - If you have questions on how to draw a picture, but need some suggestions, there is the community to help:\r\n    - StackOverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/skiasharp\r\n    - Xamarin Forums: https://forums.xamarin.com\r\n    - Gitter.im Chat: https://gitter.im/xamarin/XamarinComponents\r\n - If you have questions on skia, or need to ask more advanced questions about the native API, the skia Group is the place to go: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/skia-discuss\r\n\r\nBut... If you still aren\u0027t sure about where to ask your question, then go ahead and ask here! We will try and answer you, but if we can\u0027t, then we will help you get the answers you want.\r\n\r\n--\u003E\r\nI wasn\u0027t able to find any information about whether SkiaSharp supports DirectX12 natively. Additionally if it doesn\u0027t, does it at least support DirectX11?",
