        "body": "@petergolde,\n\nYes adding docs would be a great help!  We need to write up some instructions in the README.\n\nFor now what I have been doing is running in bash\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\nsh bootstrapper.sh -t docs\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThis will modify the docs directory, adding stubs for the classes and members that were added.  The problem that I have is that a bunch of whitespace diffs are introduced when I run this as well.  (I need to get with miguel to see why that is.)  I revert the changes I do not want, then fill in the new stubbed out doc entries.  \n\nTo verify my changes I then run...\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\nmdoc-export-html -o bill docs/en/\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThe output from this is not perfect either, but will give you a set of html pages to view and review your new changes.  Finally commit the changes to the docs folder.  \n\nMake sense?  \n",
