I actually just downloaded the source tar as part of the steps:\r\nhttps://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/blob/master/cake/BuildExternals.cake#L715-L739\r\n\r\nAfter downloading, I manually created project files (MSBuild, Xcode, Tizen, Makefile) for each platform to compile. I haven\u0027t gotten around to updating and using the CMake targets. The actual version that gets pulled in is read from this file:\r\nhttps://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/blob/master/VERSIONS.txt#L5\r\n\r\nJust another thing: if this layout is not practical, or you need to get it to build another way, then go ahead and make the adjustments. Due to poor reasoning, it is the way it is now because that is how it was then \uD83D\uDE04 Also, the harfbuzz repo has come a long way since 2017.",

I believe this was because i didn\u0027t want to have to depend on cygwin and things like that. As a result, I just downloaded the files and used the platform project files.\r\n\r\nWe could switch to a submodule and then just include the files we care about. In fact, rather than downloading this file, I would actually prefer all dependencies as submodules in the externals folder. Both for consistency, and because we will always need all the dependencies for all platforms - \u0027cause we work ev\u0027rywhere!",
