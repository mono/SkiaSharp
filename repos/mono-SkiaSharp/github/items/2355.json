  "body": "I\u0027ve been reading different articles on the subject, and my take away is that Maui with WinUI cannot yet work with GPU accelerated graphics. I\u0027m currently trying to port a game my company has been writing from Xamarin to Maui. I can\u0027t seem to get the SKGLView to work. It\u0027s giving me an error of a missing handler. I added the code to the main MauiProgram builder .UsinSkiaSharp(true) to no avail.\r\n\r\nIs this still a current issue or is it that I\u0027m doing something wrong?\r\nIs OpenTK an option?\r\nOr maybe Win2D?\r\nThe game would run far too slowly without acceleration. \r\nAny help is appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe game demo is currently available on the Microsoft Marketplace for testing.\r\n\r\nSince we\u0027re all developers here, I\u0027ll leave the link to it with using Xamarin.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9P5QG567VSFK\r\n",
