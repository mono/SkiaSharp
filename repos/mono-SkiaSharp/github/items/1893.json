  "title": "Support for GPU Acceleration for WinUI3",
  "body": "GPU Acceleration is important in SkiaSharp for scenarios where you have large fill areas on high dpi monitors, as well as just general performance maximization. It\u0027s important that GPU acceleration is also supported for the WinUI3 platform.\r\n\r\nIt seems the challenge was lack of support for Angle. Is this still valid? Are there alternatives?\r\n",

The current implementation is just for UWP and the ANGLE team is not really interested in adding another Windows platform.\r\n\r\nSince we are already using all the Google build tools such as gn/ninja, we _can_ build it as part of the SkiaSharp build. However, someone needs to do the bit of work to update the type references and somehow (I am not sure yet) reference all the correct files in the WindowsAppSDK nuget package.\r\n\r\nOnce we get a build of ANGLE for WinUI 3, then I can uncomment the code that we already have for the SkiaSharp GL view.\r\n\r\nAs of today, none of the work is really SkiaSharp or native skia work.\r\n\r\nAll the work needs to be done is to fork (and hopefully PR back) the Google ANGLE code and make the required modifications: https://chromium.googlesource.com/angle/angle\r\n\r\nThe required code is probably all here: https://github.com/levinli303/vcpkg/tree/angle-winui\r\n\r\nBut instead of SkiaSharp depending on layers of patches and then using vcpkg to build those patches, we should just make those modifications in a normal way and upstream. Google is open to a nice PR and I am sure if we _just_ get the code changes to them they will accept it. They are probably not really interested in building and testing the new platform - not sure they do that for UWP anyways.\r\n\r\nI see the forked vcpkg does a lot of things to extract and generate files - and we can do that too in the ANGLE code using some python scripts. All doable, just I do not have the time to work on that.",

This may have been self inflicted, for example, perhaps I was creating and destroying resources that need to be cached.\r\n\r\nBUT, I heavily suspect based on my past interactions with Direct2D both directly and via WPF that there are some inefficiencies how Direct2D tessellates a complex polyline to render it on the GPU. Perhaps this has been fixed in later versions of Direct2D, though.\r\n\r\nTry this as an example. Create a polyline that oscillates up and down in the y direction entirely randomly and with high frequency. Render this in WPF and modify it with a high framerate. This will bring WPF to its knees. Again, could be fixed in later Direct2d (doesn\u0027t help WPF) but may help Win2d. \r\n\r\nAnyhow, I don\u0027t know if it was scenarios like that which were causing the performance to be worse than software based Skia. But that\u0027s one of the scenarios I\u0027ve experienced in the past that Skia handles much more gracefully than WPF (old Direct2d)\r\n\r\nFunny story actually. The Chromium/Skia team actually broke this scneario when they first enabled the GPU support in Chrome, and I needed to report a bug, which they then fixed (not sure how, maybe they adjusted the way the prepped the lines for the GPU, or maybe they detect the scenario with heuristics and use a raster fallback)\r\n\r\nhttps://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=102165\u0026can=1\u0026q=reporter%3Agmurray%40gmail.com\r\n\r\nAnyhow, may not be that scenario, since I don\u0027t think I was testing anything related to that. But this is an example of the fact that what I\u0027m testing is non-trivial polyline and polygon rendering. So perhaps Win2D is not optimized enough for certain types of shapes, etc, because traditionally Direct2D has _definitely_ had some issues in this regard. To this day, you can feed a shape like this to WPF and it will just refuse to process it well.",

The nature of my interaction with Win2D is also pretty chatty and from C# so there could be too much tax being paid to just funnel the information to Win2D for rendering.

You mention WPF, but that has its own **DX9** renderer. I\u0027m talking about Win2D, which runs on top of D2D, which uses **DX11** behind the scenes. WPF does _not_ use D2D in its renderer. Unless you specifically used Win2D (or D2D directly) from WPF (ie. you either referenced Win2D and used its canvas control via a XAML Island, or manually setup the Win32 interop to manage an HWND-based swapchain, or something else), then chances are you didn\u0027t actually use D2D at all. Is it possible there\u0027s a misunderstanding there about the various technologies? And if you _did_ in fact use D2D, then yeah you most definitely just did something wrong, because as I said I just don\u0027t see how it could possibly be slower than Skia in software mode (or even if it was hardware accelerated), that just doesn\u0027t really make sense to me \uD83D\uDE05\r\n\r\nEg. you talked about \u0022creating a polyline\u0022.
