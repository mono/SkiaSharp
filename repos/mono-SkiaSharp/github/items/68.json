        "body": "@migueldeicaza I don\u0027t have a sample written, but the motivating use case (for me) is to traverse SKPaths in order to compute bounding boxes. I know there exist other Skia methods for computing rough bounding boxes, but I need tight boxes including path effects like stroking, and I haven\u0027t found methods that do that yet. Currently I\u0027m accomplishing it by maintaining \u0022shadow\u0022 paths in my C# code, e.g. just lists of the SKPoints, which allows me to traverse the points to compute the bounding boxes. It\u0027s fine with me if you\u0027d like to close this issue, as perhaps it\u0027s outside of the scope of what SkiaSharp should worry about.\n",
