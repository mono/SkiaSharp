        "body": "@Tylerflick saw this and I was already working on something very similar. I did almost what you did but did most of the work in the C# layer, just exposing the \u0060SkPixmap\u0060 type from the C layer. This will provide additional options for other APIs. Also, I moved the test in from the C layer to the C# layer so that they can be run by CI. I don\u0027t actually run the C tests - I do the testing via the interop so I can test both the C and the C# in one go.",
