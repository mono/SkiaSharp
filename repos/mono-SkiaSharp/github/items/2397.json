  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nI\u0027d like to paint text with font variation options but the needed API is not exposed to HarfBuzzSharp nor SkiaSharp.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you\u0027d like**\r\n\r\nRequested Skia api:\r\nhttps://api.skia.org/structSkFontParameters.html\r\nhttps://api.skia.org/classSkTypeface.html#a01b379aa05f1d89af547e32ce3fabbe1\r\n\r\nRequested HarfBuzz api:\r\nhttps://harfbuzz.github.io/harfbuzz-hb-font.html#hb-font-set-variations\r\n\r\n\u003C!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. --\u003E\r\n\r\nWe are looking to plumb [font-variation-settings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-variation-settings) through to render variable fonts.  To do this we need to be able to set variation values by their tags (\u0060wght\u0060, \u0060slnt\u0060, etc) in shaping and painting.  I think exposing the above api should cover it, though this is new to me and I may be missing something.",
