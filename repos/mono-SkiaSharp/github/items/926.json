  "title": "[QUESTION] Shaping Arabic Date",
  "body": "I am using SkiaSharp with SkiaSharp.Harfbuzz in a Xamarin App and it works fine with RTL languages like arabic.\r\n\r\nI am currently facing a problem displaying an arabic date.\r\nIt works fine if it starts with arabic characters, but if it starts with a number it does not shape the text correctly.\r\n\r\nThe following date shows up correctly in canvas:\r\n8 yluJ\r\n\r\nIn this example yluJ is July in arabic.\r\n\r\nThis date is not shaped correctly:\r\nyluJ 8\r\n\r\nI figured out it is a problem if the text starts with an LTR-Text following by an RTL text.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to force SkiaSharp.Hafbuzz to use arabic shaping? Or is there any other way around this?",

        "body": "I need the actual encoded text to explain / investigate this further. In general HarfBuzz doesn\u0027t apply the BiDi algorithm and also just checks the first character of the text for Unicode properties. If the text starts with a LTR character the whole buffer is shaped with this direction.",
