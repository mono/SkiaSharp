  "body": "Hi!\r\n\r\nMy code looks like:\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060csharp\r\nSK3dView v = new SK3dView();\r\nv.Translate(10, 10, 0); //x10, y10, z0\r\nusing (SKCanvas canvas = surface.Canvas) {\r\n  canvas.SetMatrix(v.Matrix);\r\n  canvas.DrawRect(new SKRect(0, 0, 100, 100), new SKPaint() { \r\n    Color = new SKColor(255, 0, 0), \r\n    IsAntialias = true, });\r\n}\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\nNow the painted rectangle is not on the position x[10], y[10] (as I would expect it), its is on the position x[10], y[-10].\r\nIs this a correct behavior?\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nThe Z-Axis has the same behavior. A negative value makes the rectangle appear greater and a positive value makes the rectangle appear smaller.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nSora",

        "body": "I think this is the desired/correct functionality.\r\nHere is a fiddle: https://fiddle.skia.org/c/1554299ac982bee3eb824a4b1985a87b\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1096616/22620749/f9337b26-eb2b-11e6-8cf2-eba685b7e814.png)\r\n\r\nThere are 4 rectangles:\r\n1. GRAY - initial/base\r\n2. GREEN - moved \u002B50 pixels along the X axis\r\n3. BLUE - moved \u002B50 along the Y axis\r\n4. RED - moved \u002B200 pixels along the Z axis\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the origin is the bottom, left (typical in 3D spaces) and the Z direction is away from the screen. (I moved the canvas origin to the center of the screen for better demonstration)\r\n\r\nIt is important to remember that this transformation doesn\u0027t change the actual canvas matrix origin. It is still the top left.",
