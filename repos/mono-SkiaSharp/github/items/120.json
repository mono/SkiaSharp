  "title": "Add SVG support to SkiaSharp",
  "body": "I think that full SVG support should be added to the SkiaSharp library, including SVG Animations ( https://svgwg.org/specs/animations/ ). \n\nIf SkiaSharp is going to be the engine behind Xamarin.Forms (and the whole WPF crossplatform), then SVG support is as necessary as PNG or JPG support. \nYou cannot treat SVG as a external option, something that you can delegate to a secondary framework made by amateurs.\nIt is the main vector image format around. 90% of all vector graphic resources (icons, graphic elements, UI skins, animations, backgrounds, etc...) are made in SVG, exported in SVG and distributed in SVG. Artists and designers are used to save their vector images in SVG format. App design tools like Sketch or AdobeXD export the app design storyboards as SVG files, ready to be imported in the app. Popular mobile apps like Viber use SVG SMIL animations extensively for ALL their awesome animated stickers. With the advent of the modern high density display jungle, everybody is dropping bitmap assets for SVG assets.\nIntro animations for the \u0022Onboarding\u0022 phase of new apps are now often made with SVG SMIL animated clips. The new popular SVG morphing algorithms are now used by many design tools to create animated visual transitions easily between UI states, just by choosing a start and an end SVG image. From those two inbetweens are automatically generated at 60 fps, for a smooth and modern UI.\nNo vector framework is going to succeed with developers without SVG support, no more than a bitmap imaging framework without PNG or JPG support. Other crossplatform 2D libraries like NGraphics for example already support SVG.\nThis is very urgent, otherwise Xamarin.Forms is going to be more and more detached from the needs of modern app development.\n",

        "body": "It is also my opinion, that SVG is a very important backend (I believe it is called this way in Skia?).\nIt is even way more important than the PDF support you added recently. So I am hoping this won\u0027t be too much effort? (_fingerscrossed_)\n\nWe are already creating our own port of a SVG library using SkiaSharp.\nHowever, our goal is to have a vector-graphics based editor for mobile platforms. \nSo advanced animations and filters will not be provided by us and also, as it is not native and includes all the callbacks and a rather compliated object model, it surely won\u0027t be fast enough for the purposes mentioned by @Emasoft \n\nNevertheless, you guys are doing a great job! I really love SkiaSharp. It even made me try to work with C\u002B\u002B and C again ;-)\n",

        "body": "SVG is not supported by Skia itself, and thus is outside the scope of this project.\n\nNothing is preventing an additional library from being created that can load SVG files, but it is not part of the SkiaSharp project, unless you get Google to add SVG support directly to Skia.   Which is rather unlikely for reasons stated somewhere else on the bug reporting system.\n",

        "body": "That is a good point, @migueldeicaza.\nNevertheless, it would be a superb addition to the Xamarin toolset.\nAs I am not planning to work fulltime on our SVG port, we will, however, never implement things as animations and the like.\nAlso, as it is a full blown SVG rendering **and editing** framework, it will never be as fast as a pure render lib. But I would be very happy to see our efforts supported by you :)\n",

        "body": "@gentledepp Unfortunately I think that Skia is a dead end after all. I don\u0027t know why Miguel picked it, but nobody uses it on Android anymore because it is not hardware accelerated. We need an hardware accelerated crossplatform solution, like NGraphics (it uses the native calls of iOS and Android sdk on mobile, that are hardware accelerated, and DX on Windows), not an old and slow lib like Skia. \nIf I were in Miguel, I would buy NGraphics and start developing a cross platform WPF implementation with it, so that XAML code in Xamarin.Forms would be the same on all platforms, and SVG support in Xamarin.Forms would be obtained as a bonus.\nCurrently Xamarin.Forms is too slow (even using the XAMLC), and you need hacks like the TwinTechs FastCell library to get even a decent listview scroll speed.\nPorting Skia to C# as a Xamarin library is a waste of time. Miguel should just hire Frank A. Krueger and some other passionate developer like you, and start to invest massively in NGraphics as the next backbone of Xamarin.Forms.\n",
