  "body": "on \u0060SKCanvas\u0060 I am drawing multiple bitmaps and let user scale, drag and rotate that images.\r\nEverything works fine but \u0060OnPaintSurface\u0060 is called 2 times for 1 bitmap. Because of this, my performance gets slow after some time.\r\nThese things are decided by OS from device or are managed in plugin itself ?\r\n\r\nPlease help !",
