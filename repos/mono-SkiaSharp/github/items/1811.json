So you don\u0027t need AOT for anything except a bunch of pinvokes and a few lines of code.\r\n\r\nAnd then skia is just naturally fast. And the 60 FPS is the limit set by the browser ticker. It uses 60 FPS and I hook into it. I bet I can go faster if I used a setInterval or something.",

I am going to make both views do the same thing with a render loop. I was going for a canvas view is on-demand by default, but for the html/js stuff, there is no clean way to do a loop for managed code with all weird timers. So, I might as well do it right in js with the frame and then all is well.",
