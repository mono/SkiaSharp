Its from the Nuget package right?\r\n\r\nWhat is the difference between SkiaSharp.dll and libSkiaSharp.dll?",

        "body": "Thanks for reporting this. I had a look and I can confirm that the VSMac runner seems to not copy the native binaries. All is working on Windows. I have contacted the VSMac teams this side to see if they know if there is a bug or something.\r\n\r\nWith regards to the differences between the assemblies... SkiaSharp.dll is a managed assembly that is written in C# and allows you to write code in C#. The libSkiaSharp.dll/.dylib/.so is the platform-specific, native binary that is the underlying skia engine. Depending on the platform, the same SkiaSharp assembly talks to the different versions of libSkiaSharp.",
