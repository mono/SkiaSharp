  "title": "SKMatrix.Concat Ambiguity in VB.Net",
  "body": "The SkMatrix.Concat method has two options: with and without \u0027ref\u0027 values. Unfortunately, I am forced into using VB.Net, which cannot specify which Concat method to use except through reflection. Thus, in VB.Net, I will get a compile error \u0022\u0027Concat\u0027 is ambiguous because multiple kinds of members with this name exist in structure \u0027SKMatrix\u0027.\u0022  Could I kindly ask that two methods be named slightly different to make it more friendly with other languages such as VB.Net? For instance, maybe:\r\n\r\n      public static void Concat(ref SKMatrix target, SKMatrix first, SKMatrix second);\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n      public static void ConcatRef(ref SKMatrix target, ref SKMatrix first, ref SKMatrix second);\r\n\r\nOr add a wrapper for VB.Net that calls one of those methods with a different name (This would extend the API without breaking any current functionality). And also make you aware of problems such as this for future design.\r\nThanks",
