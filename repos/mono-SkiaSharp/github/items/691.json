  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nIt appears that in later releases of skia, more items were added to the metadata class, but this was not translated into the C# equivalent. Also, the \u0060dpi\u0060 parameter of the \u0060CreatePdf\u0060 overloads were removed (because they were added to the metadata), but never actually added to the metadata.\n\n\u003E VS bug [#732193](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/732193)",
