        "body": "Reading through that issue and the solutions it doesn\u0027t seem that complicated to add support either. The only problematic part, having worked with tiff in System.Drawing, is that tiff supports a wide variety of pixel formats so it might take some effort to get full support for all of those.\n\nHowever, that\u0027s also why this would be a great addition as the ability to store a lot of higher bitrate formats is useful for applications that require that sort of bit depth.",
