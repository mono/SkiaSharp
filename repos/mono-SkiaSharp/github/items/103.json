  "body": "Hi!\n\nI am currently developing an SVG editor for Android (but very likely also for iOS, UWP, etc.)\nMy problem now is, that I would like to store an SKBitmap to a file as PNG.\nI saw that there is a SKImageEncoder which does the job, but it is not mapped yet.\nAny chances this will change in the near future? (I do not like workarounds)\n\nhttps://github.com/google/skia/blob/master/src/images/SkImageEncoder.cpp\n",
