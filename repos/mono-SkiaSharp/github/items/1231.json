But user can create a non rectangle shapes. I know i need to do a matrix transformation to return normal image but i don\u0027t know how to get specific part of bitmap to transform\r\n\r\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63102347/79326609-6abb7e00-7f13-11ea-81d8-ed8ac632b0b4.png\u0022 width=\u0022300\u0022 /\u003E\r\n\r\nCan u help me?\r\nThanks in advance for the answer.",
