Please describe.**\r\n\r\nBased on https://github.com/beto-rodriguez/LiveCharts2/issues/602\r\n\r\nWhen a SKColor is created using the \u0060uint\u0060 constructor the alpha channel is 0 by default.\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\nvar a = new SKColor(0xD65282);\r\nvar b = new SKColor(0xFFD65282);\r\n\r\nvar alphaEquals = a.Alpha == b.Alpha ;\r\n// should be true by default?\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you\u0027d like**\r\n\r\nIt would be more intuitive that the alpha channel is \u0060255\u0060 instead of zero when it is not specified.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you\u0027ve considered**\r\n\r\nSet the alpha channel manually.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nnone.\r\n",

(not sure if that is something that people do)\r\n\r\nThis is also a breaking change, so not sure how possible if people are doing things with 0 alpha...\r\n\r\nMaybe the unexpectedness of this warrants a change.",

The alpha channel is by default to \u0027ff\u0027 unless you specify it, there are multiple color tables on hexadecimal format, like [material colors](https://material.io/resources/color/#!/?view.left=0\u0026view.right=0\u0026primary.color=9575CD) or [fluent colors](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/styles/web/colors/shared).\r\n\r\nIf this is implemented it would more intuitive to get a color from any color table on the web:\r\n\r\n![skiacolor](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10853349/194145073-ef0ddce8-08ce-4290-8329-3878ed375c51.gif)\r\n\r\nNot sure if the breaking change is worth.\r\n",
