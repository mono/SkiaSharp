Also, can you try a rebuild?\r\n\r\nThis is basically a manifestation of a bug in some part of Xamarin.iOS where it wasn\u0027t copying the new binaries to the device. However, this was fixed in v2, but the first run needs a rebuild - or even an uninstall of the app on the device.\r\n\r\nHowever, after uninstalling the app and doing a rebuild, all future updates should not have this issue.",
