        "body": "This was also my first idea, but i check the certificate and the provisioning files 10 times all Dates are correct and true til march 2023.\n\nAlso i try to move back from 2.80.3 to 2.80.2 that has worked 2 weeks ago. Results in the same error.\n\nI\u2019m not an expert for Apple and don\u2019t know exaclty what the Transporter App Checks during upload to the App-Store. May by somebody has a tip how to find the real reason.\n\nA deployment to Appcenter.ms was possible and a Installation on a registered device was successfully.\nThis is signed with the same certificate. So i believe this is ok.\n\nAny Idea ?\n\nVon: Matthew ***@***.***\u003E\nGesendet: Dienstag, 19.
