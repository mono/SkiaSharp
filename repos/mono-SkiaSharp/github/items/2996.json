  "title": "[FEATURE] Add support for creating DirectX and Metal GR contexts.",
  "body": "### Is your feature request related to a problem?\n\nI\u0027d like to have DirectX to be used in my SkiaSharp-based library on Windows, for creating a custom window backdrop, but it seems like there\u0027s no GRContext.CreateDX... And using OpenGL and DX at the same time is... absurd.\n\n### Describe the solution you would like\n\nI\u0027d like to have DirectX GRContext support... Like you create a Direct3D 11 device, the create a SS cavcass with it...\n\n### Describe alternatives you have considered\n\nNone...\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project\u0027s Code of Conduct",
