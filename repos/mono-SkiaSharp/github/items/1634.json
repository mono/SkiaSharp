  "body": "**Description of Change**\r\n\r\nAdd support for \u0060SKXamlCanvas\u0060 on Uno Platform SkiaSharp backends, by using software rendering onto an off-screen surface.\r\n\r\nWhile the \u0060SKSwapChainPanel\u0060 is present (as it is part of the reference API shared with WebAssembly), it is currently not implemented.\r\n\r\nIn order to support this change, the \u0060SKXamlCanvas\u0060 which was incorrectly inheriting from \u0060FrameworkElement\u0060, is now inheriting from \u0060Canvas\u0060, which exposes the \u0060Background\u0060 property. **It is a breaking change**, but all the properties of \u0060FrameworkElement\u0060 are also present on \u0060Canvas\u0060, which will not break existing code.\r\n\r\nNote that non-breaking fixes are needed in Uno for this change to work properly (https://github.com/unoplatform/uno/pull/5266), those will be included as part of Uno 3.5.x and 3.6.\r\n\r\n**API Changes**\r\n\r\n\u003C!-- REPLACE THIS COMMENT\r\nList all API changes here (or just put None), example:\r\n--\u003E\r\nChanged:\r\n\r\n - \u0060SKXamlCanvas : FrameworkElement\u0060 -\u003E \u0060SKXamlCanvas : Canvas\u0060\r\n\r\n**Behavioral Changes**\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n**PR Checklist**\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has tests (if omitted, state reason in description)\r\n- [x] Rebased on top of main at time of PR\r\n- [x] Changes adhere to coding standard\r\n- [x] Updated documentation\r\n",

        "body": "Sorry about the incredibly delay, MAUI was a bit of beast :)\r\n\r\nIs it possible to add a sample for the Skia backends? Only has to be a basic sample in say \u0060samples\\Basic\\Uno\\SkiaSharpSample.Xxx\u0060? The WASM sample probably will be the easiest to copy for the targets and props - if they are needed.\r\n\r\nI notice there is a targets file to set the \u0060UnoRuntimeEnabledPackage\u0060 property. If one is needed (very likely if I understand), then just move it to the \u0060source\\SkiaSharp.Views.Uno\\SkiaSharp.Views.Uno\u0060 folder and link both WASM and the skia backends to copy it. That way all the samples can get it instead of having to build a specific one.\r\n\r\nNow that I got some time, I hope to merge this and release a preview.",
