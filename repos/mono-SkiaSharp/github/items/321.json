Paths are translated but only sometimes. The control gives scrolling first priority. \r\n\r\nPlease give me suggestions.\r\nThank you.",

        "body": "I think the issue is that you are using gestures and a scroll view. Only one can receive events at a time.\r\n\r\nIt might be best to not use a scroll view, but rather just translate/rotate the actual canvas. This has the additional benefit that the canvas is smaller, and consumes less memory.",
