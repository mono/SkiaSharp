  "body": "### Is your feature request related to a problem?\n\nPlease upgrade the WinUI package to reference Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK.WinUI 1.8, so that it no longer relies on the Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK metapackage that\u0027ll force you and any other library that depends on Skia (like .NET MAUI) to pull in the entire metapackage.\n\n### Describe the solution you would like\n\nReduce WinAppSDK dependency to only rely on the WinUI package\n\n### Describe alternatives you have considered\n\n-\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project\u0027s Code of Conduct",

Not doing this has the downside effect that you can\u2019t reduce your dependencies down the stack but will forever be required to reference the full meta package. The meta package becomes a viral dependency even though nothing in the stack required anything but the WinUI package.\nIt\u2019s a bit on all us 3rd party library developers to fix the low level dependencies first so higher-level projects can reap the benefits",

The only thing we can blame the WinAppSDK team was how long it took them to split up the packages. Now that it is finally done, it\u0027s on us to take advantage of it, and unblock the rest of the ecosystem to do the same thing.\n\n\u003E Do you mean that MAUI RC2 can\u0027t happen if SkiaSharp is not updated\n\nI mean it can\u0027t happen the right way. You\u0027ll continue to be forcing meta package requirement on anything down-stream. If you move to 1.8, you should stop using the metapackage all-together, but MAUI can\u0027t because other dependencies hasn\u0027t done the same thing. That\u0027s exactly why the dependencies have to do it first and then work your way up the dependency stack.",
