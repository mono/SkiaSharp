  "title": "[FEATURE] Add GrTriangulator from Skia",
  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nOn GPU backed surfaces, it is faster to use \u02CBDrawVertices() instead of \u02CBDrawPath()\u02CB. So it would be helpful to have the native \u02CBGrTriangulator\u02CB (see [here)](https://github.com/google/skia/blob/master/src/gpu/GrTriangulator.h) to convert a path with a polygon to vertices.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you\u0027d like**\r\nA static function that does the work.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you\u0027ve considered**\r\nPerhaps a C# implementation for this could be used. But a ready made Skia version, which is maintained by the Skia team would be the better way.\r\n",
