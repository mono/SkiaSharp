  "body": "### Discussed in https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/discussions/1884\r\n\r\n\u003Cdiv type=\u0027discussions-op-text\u0027\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Csup\u003EOriginally posted by **robloo** December  8, 2021\u003C/sup\u003E\r\nIt seems @mattleibow is the sole maintainer of this repository. I\u0027m not sure how scalable that is long term. For example, I am guessing he is on a well deserved vacation yet building with Uno Platform 4.x is completely broken right now. As several companies depend on SkiaSharp, having responsibility left to a single individual is a high risk.\r\n\r\nI know this project is backed by Microsoft. However, I wonder who is on the SkiaSharp team besides @mattleibow? We need the ability to review patches and potentially do a preview release while he is away. This is just good stewardship of the project and helps mitigate risks for the vast number of consumers of this project.\r\n\r\nYou do great work @mattleibow and I know you are spread quite thin on time these days. I just want to start the discussion about other maintainers to this repo -- nothing against the amazing work you have done to date.\u003C/div\u003E",

The issues continue to build up because there is only one person to get to them.\r\n\r\nI greatly, greatly appreciate the existence and work that goes into this repository and NuGet package. However, at least right now, I am unable to use SkiaSharp due to issues with it on desktop, both macOS and Windows. Both issues are due to either SkiaSharp exceptions that leave no stack trace or .NET crashes due to SkiaSharp, and I have little idea how to debug them. I\u0027m already writing my own bindings for GLFW. Now I am wondering if I need to do the same for Skia or use something else or some other platform (other than .NET).",
