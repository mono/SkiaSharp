I\u0027m not sure how scalable that is long term. For example, I am guessing he is on a well deserved vacation yet building with Uno Platform 4.x is completely broken right now. As several companies depend on SkiaSharp, having responsibility left to a single individual is a high risk.\r\n\r\nI know this project is backed by Microsoft. However, I wonder who is on the SkiaSharp team besides @mattleibow? We need the ability to review patches and potentially do a preview release while he is away. This is just good stewardship of the project and helps mitigate risks for the vast number of consumers of this project.\r\n\r\nYou do great work @mattleibow and I know you are spread quite thin on time these days. I just want to start the discussion about other maintainers to this repo -- nothing against the amazing work you have done to date.\u003C/div\u003E",
