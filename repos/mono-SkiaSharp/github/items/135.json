  "body": "I\u0027m seeing what seems like a regression bug. The following code (unless I\u0027m missing something obvious) should not throw an exception:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\nusing (SKPaint p = new SKPaint()) {\n    p.IsStroke = false;\n    if (p.IsStroke != false) {\n        throw new Exception();\n    }\n}\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nBut with SkiaSharp 1.53, I am seeing the exception thrown. When I downgrade to 1.49.1, the bug goes away (no exception thrown). This is on Win7 SP1 with VS 2015 Community Update 2, .NET framework 4.5.2. \n",
