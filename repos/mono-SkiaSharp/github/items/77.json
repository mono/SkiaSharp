  "title": "Change the native library names to libSkiaSharp",
  "body": "I have just been working with @galvesribeiro to get SkiaSharp onto a ARM v6l Linux device (yay!) #18. One of the issues was that we had to re-build SkiaSharp just so that we could change the native library name in the \u0060[DllImport]\u0060. \n\nWhat are the opinions of changing the native library name to a uniform \u0060libSkiaSharp\u0060 so that future Linux (or any other \u0022normal\u0022 builds) can just use the Desktop assembly?\n\nWe might even remove the need for the .dll.config file currently. (just a guess)\n",
