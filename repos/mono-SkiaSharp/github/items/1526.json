  "body": "1. Open visual studio\r\n2. Write a simple console app that creates an \u0060SKMatrix\u0060 into a variable and prints it in a second row.\r\n3. Launch app with debugging and try to peek values of \u0060SKMatrix\u0060.\r\n4. App is crashed.\r\n\r\nSource of a crash is \u0060IsInvertible\u0060 property.\r\n\r\nMe and 2 other devs has this issue. I hope you can repro it too. This issue is critical, because it disables any matrix calculation debugging scenarios.",

Unless you saw that already and it didn\u0027t fix the issue?\n\nIt should be fixed in preview 9. You can check out the actual fix https://github.com/mono/skia/commit/a7b3674c74e3b0b5252cc8cc3e41168c5b6b7492\n\nBasically, the managed code was passing null as the dest matrix, but then I didn\u0027t check it.
