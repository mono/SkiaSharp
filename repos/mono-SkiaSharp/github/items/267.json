        "body": "If you can get a repo, then I can have a look. Also, what platform are you on?\r\n\r\nI tested with the canvas as the root view, a child of a grid and stack layout. All adhere to the margin property.\r\n\r\nFor the case with no width/height or vertical/horizontal options, the canvas has no intrinsic size, since it is merely a drawing surface. In order to make sure it will be displayed, either a dimension must be specified, or a sizing option. For example, if you place it in a vertical stack layout, the width will stretch to the container width, and the height will fall back to 0. In this case, either use a grid to expand, or set an explicit height.",

It works awesome by the way!\r\n\r\nI\u0027ll pull the code out and see if I can make it repo what I saw.\r\n\r\nThanks. ",

        "body": "@mattleibow there is something odd going on.  Something about padding and margin.  I\u0027m not 100% convinced it is the SkiaView.  Totally get what you are saying about the canvas, makes perfect sense, it is definitely not that. \r\n\r\nI\u0027m flat out with work so I\u0027ll close this for the moment while I spend some time convincing myself one way or the other :)\r\n\r\nthanks for the help!\r\n",
