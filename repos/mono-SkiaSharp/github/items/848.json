        "body": "We\u0027ve been reviewing this matter and we can conclude that the concerns about pdf output file size cannot be improved because the following... it seems that Skia (native lib) [PDF backend design](https://skia.org/dev/design/pdftheory#Fonts) will embed any font file needed to render the text at the target device. That page states the following:\r\n\r\n\u003E We can\u0027t assume that an arbitrary font will be available at PDF view time, so we embed all fonts in accordance with modern PDF guidelines.\r\n\r\nThe sample here [https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/blob/master/samples/Gallery/Shared/Samples/CreatePdfSample.cs](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/blob/master/samples/Gallery/Shared/Samples/CreatePdfSample.cs) will use the default font in the system, which under Windows, it\u0027s likely to be \u0060Segoe UI\u0060 which TTF file size is about 900KB\r\nThe output PDF file for that simple test where a single text is drawn is about 510KB. That big size for such a simple pdf is because \u0060Segoe UI\u0060 font file is embedded in the file by Skia design. We\u0027ve made another tests by drawing Chinese text using the \u0060Yu Gothic\u0060 font which file size is about 13MB! and the output pdf file is about 8MB! which confirms that the size is because the font files being embedded. Linked fonts seems not to be supported which could make the pdf output file size smaller. \r\n\r\nIf no one here has more comments on this matter, then @mattleibow you can close this issue. ",

But, since it is fairly simple, we might be able to do something. The API hasn\u0027t changed much, so it might just be safe to do something. \r\n\r\nI\u0027ll have a look at what we can do. Can\u0027t promise anything as I haven\u0027t had a look at exactly how the PDF is constructed, but it seems to only write the fonts when the PDF is closed, so we could potentially add a argument there, or in the metadata in the constructor. They actually have an enum there that allows you to pick either harfbuzz or sfntly. Seems to be not too hard to add one for us, and then we can use _any_ font subsetter.",

If you only generate a single pdf, no one cares for a 2 MB PDF on their PC.

Then a 2 MB file every 2 seconds costs a hell lot of storage and that\u0027s just not going to work",

It seems to work fine.\n\n@jeffska did you ever think of opening a PR for this change? Would this be welcome, @mattleibow ? This is such a great project, however the PDF file size issue keeps coming back all the time. I\u0027d rather not have to fork and lose the benefits of main line support. However I can offer to create a PR and do thorough testing if there\u0027s a chance for getting a merge. ",
