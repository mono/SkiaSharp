  "body": "**Description**\r\nI am trying to scale a bitmap in and out multiple times. I wanted to keep quality so the successive scale operations will not accumulate bad quality as each scale will be generated from the original bitmap.\r\n\r\nSo I used SKBitmap.Copy to get the original bitmap, and SKBitmap.ScalePixels to scale it. but aparently SKBitmap.Copy is shallow and **SKBitmap.ScalePixels affects both the source and destination, both bitmaps will have the new size and quality!!**\r\n\r\n**Code**\r\nAttached Xamarin Forms Simple Demo\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\nSuccessive scales not to cause accumulated bad quality\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\nOriginal bitmap, it\u0027s copy, and the destination bitmap, all of them will get the same width and height of the destination in **ScalePixels** method, also accumulate bad quality as if any scaling is originated from a previous scale and applied to all bitmaps\r\n\r\n**Basic Information**\r\nXamarin Forms 4.6.0.847\r\nAndroid 9 and 10, Pixel Emulator\r\nWindows 10 \r\n\r\n[SkiaTest.zip](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/files/4776780/SkiaTest.zip)",
