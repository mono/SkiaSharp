        "body": "@VijayRM this might be something that you might have to do. For example, you can first try the direct lookup, and if that fails use the \u0060SKFontManager.FontFamilies\u0060 property to get all the available families. This could give you more control on all the platforms to find fonts that match what you are looking for - for example do a \u0022starts with\u0022 search as well.",
