  "title": "[QUESTION] InvalidateSurface to a rectangle",
  "body": "Coming from windows GDI, it is possible to Invalidate the entire surface or just a specific region. So far, I have not found the method to Invalidate to a rectangle in SkiaSharp. I find it necessary to invalidate small regions of the surface when drawing hundreds of points on the surface and moving just a few of them, or for the case a of gps cursor, I want to invalidate just the cursor and not the entire image behind it. \r\n\r\nSo the question is--Is it possible to InvalidateSurface() with subset of the screen?",
