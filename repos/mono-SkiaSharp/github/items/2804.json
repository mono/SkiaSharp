This Agreement is effective as of the latest signature date below.\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E **1. Definitions.**\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E **\u201CCode\u201D** means the computer software code, whether in human-readable or machine-executable form, that is delivered by You to .NET Foundation under this Agreement.\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E **\u201CProject\u201D** means any of the projects owned or managed by .NET Foundation and offered under a license approved by the Open Source Initiative ([www.opensource.org](http://www.opensource.org)).\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E **\u201CSubmit\u201D** is the act of uploading, submitting, transmitting, or distributing code or other content to any Project, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Project for the purpose of discussing and improving that Project, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as \u201CNot a Submission.\u201D\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E **\u201CSubmission\u201D** means the Code and any other copyrightable material Submitted by You, including any associated comments and documentation.\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E **2.

Originality of Work.** You represent that each of Your Submissions is entirely Your original work. Should You wish to Submit materials that are not Your original work, You may Submit them separately to the Project if You (a) retain all copyright and license information that was in the materials as you received them, (b) in the description accompanying your Submission, include the phrase \u0022Submission containing materials of a third party:\u0022 followed by the names of the third party and any licenses or other restrictions of which You are aware, and (c) follow any other instructions in the Project\u0027s written guidelines concerning Submissions.\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E **4.

Licenses.**\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E **a. Copyright License.** You grant .NET Foundation, and those who receive the Submission directly or indirectly from .NET Foundation, a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license in the Submission to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute the Submission and such derivative works, and to sublicense any or all of the foregoing rights to third parties.\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E **b.

Notice to .NET Foundation.** You agree to notify .NET Foundation in writing of any facts or circumstances of which You later become aware that would make Your representations in this Agreement inaccurate in any respect.\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E **8.
