This is a platform feature, so on iOS you use the \u0060CADisplayLink\u0060 and on Android you would use the \u0060Choreographer\u0060\r\n\r\nThe Forms views should be using this for the GL views. But, since the other views do not have a \u0022render loop\u0022 operation, the implementation actually needs to be implemented via the framework. Right now an option is the device timers. But this can probably be improved.\r\n\r\nDid you maybe mean something else?",
