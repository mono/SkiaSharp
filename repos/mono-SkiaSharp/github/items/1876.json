  "body": "\u003C!--\r\n\r\nYou can ask questions here, but there might be better places to do that as well:\r\n\r\n - If you have questions on how to use SkiaSharp with .NET, this is the best place.\r\n - If you have questions on how to draw a picture, but need some suggestions, there is the community to help:\r\n    - StackOverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/skiasharp\r\n    - Xamarin Forums: https://forums.xamarin.com\r\n    - Gitter.im Chat: https://gitter.im/xamarin/XamarinComponents\r\n - If you have questions on skia, or need to ask more advanced questions about the native API, the skia Group is the place to go: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/skia-discuss\r\n\r\nBut... If you still aren\u0027t sure about where to ask your question, then go ahead and ask here! We will try and answer you, but if we can\u0027t, then we will help you get the answers you want.\r\n\r\n--\u003E\r\n\r\nAfter searching the web for quite some time now, I can\u0027t find appropriate answers, for which the questions are quite simple:\r\n\r\na) Is there a method to calculate the area of an SKPath?\r\nb) Is there a way I can iterate through the SKPath and calculate the area on my own? With Gauss, maybe?",
