  "title": "[BUG] MAUI: SKCanvasView crash, unable to display SKBitmap directly",
  "body": "**Description**\r\n\r\nI try to render an \u0060SKBitmap\u0060 on the view directly. In a Xamarin multi target app I could use \u0060SKCanvasView\u0060 (from SkiaSharp.Views.Forms) and its \u0060OnPaintSurface\u0060 and it worked perfectly.\r\n\r\n**Failed attempt 1:**\r\n\r\nBut when I try the same in a MAUI app (this time \u0060SKCanvasView\u0060 is referenced from the SkiaSharp.Views.Maui.Controls package) the application crashes.\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060xaml\r\n\u003CskiaCtrls:SKCanvasView x:Name=\u0022canvasView\u0022 PaintSurface=\u0022CanvasView_OnPaintSurface\u0022 HeightRequest=\u0022100\u0022/\u003E\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060cs\r\nprivate SKBitmap bitmap;\r\n\r\nprivate void ButtonClicked(object sender, EventArgs e)\r\n{\r\n    bitmap = GenerateBitmap(); // some very standard premultiplied BGRA8888 bitmap\r\n    canvasView.InvalidateSurface(); // to invoke CanvasView_OnPaintSurface\r\n}\r\n\r\nprivate void CanvasView_OnPaintSurface(object sender, SKPaintSurfaceEventArgs e)\r\n{\r\n    if (bitmap == null)\r\n        return;\r\n    SKImageInfo info = e.Info;\r\n    SKSurface surface = e.Surface;\r\n    SKCanvas canvas = surface.Canvas;\r\n    canvas.DrawBitmap(bitmap, info.Rect);\r\n}\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\nWhereas this code worked in Xamarin, it crashes with MAUI:\r\n* Windows: \u0060Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.Frame.NavigationFailed\u0060 was unhandled.\r\nThe \u0060Exception\u0060 property of the event argument is a \u0060COMException\u0060: Catastrophic failure (0x8000FFFF (E_UNEXPECTED))\r\n* Android: Microsoft.Maui.Platform.HandlerNotFoundException: \u0027Handler not found for view SkiaSharp.Views.Maui.Controls.SKCanvasView.\u0027\r\n\r\n**Failed attempt 2:**\r\n\r\nSkiaSharp.Views.Maui.Controls has an \u0060SKBitmapImageSource\u0060 class, which appears to be an elegant solution to expose an \u0060SKBitmap\u0060 as a regular \u0060ImageSource\u0060:\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060xaml\r\n\u003CImage x:Name=\u0022imgTest\u0022 HeightRequest=\u0022100\u0022  HorizontalOptions=\u0022Center\u0022/\u003E\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060cs\r\nprivate void ButtonClicked(object sender, EventArgs e) =\u003E\r\n    imgTest.Source = new SKBitmapImageSource { Bitmap = GenerateBitmap() };\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\n* Windows: Nothing happens (the bitmap is generated but the image does not appear)\r\n* Android: System.InvalidOperationException: \u0027Unable to find a image source service for SkiaSharp.Views.Maui.ISKBitmapImageSource.\u0027\r\n\r\n**Failed attempt 3:**\r\n\r\nI tried to use a \u0060GraphicsView\u0060 instead (from the Microsoft.Maui.Controls package):\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060xaml\r\n\u003CGraphicsView x:Name=\u0022graphicsViewTest\u0022 HeightRequest=\u0022100\u0022/\u003E\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060cs\r\nprivate void ButtonClicked(object sender, EventArgs e)\r\n{\r\n    graphicsViewTest.Drawable = new SkiaImage(GenerateBitmap());\r\n    graphicsViewTest.Invalidate();\r\n}\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n* Windows: Nothing happens (the bitmap is generated but the image does not appear)\r\n* Android: NotSupportedException from SkiaImage.ToPlatformImage\r\n\r\n**Failed attempt 4:**\r\n\r\nAs per Microsoft\u0027s [guideline](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/user-interface/controls/graphicsview) I tried to create a custom \u0060IDrawable\u0060 implementation for a \u0060GraphicsView\u0060 and use the drawing operations of \u0060ICanvas\u0060:\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060xaml\r\n\u003CGraphicsView x:Name=\u0022graphicsViewTest\u0022 HeightRequest=\u0022100\u0022/\u003E\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060cs\r\nprivate SKBitmap bitmap;\r\n\r\npublic MainPage()\r\n{\r\n    InitializeComponent();\r\n    graphicsViewTest.Drawable = new MyDrawable(this);\r\n}\r\n\r\nprivate void ButtonClicked(object sender, EventArgs e)\r\n{\r\n    bitmap = GenerateBitmap();\r\n    graphicsViewTest.Invalidate();\r\n}\r\n\r\nprivate class MyDrawable : IDrawable\r\n{\r\n    private readonly MainPage owner;\r\n    public MyDrawable(MainPage owner) =\u003E this.owner = owner;\r\n\r\n    public void Draw(ICanvas canvas, RectF dirtyRect)\r\n    {\r\n        if (owner.bitmap == null)\r\n            return;\r\n        canvas.DrawImage(new SkiaImage(owner.bitmap), dirtyRect.X, dirtyRect.Y, dirtyRect.Width, dirtyRect.Height);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n* Windows: Does nothing. Turns out, it\u0027s because \u0060canvas.DrawImage\u0060 just returns if the passed \u0060IImage\u0060 is not a \u0060W2DImage\u0060. (???!!!) Doesn\u0027t it violate a lot of design rules?\r\n* Android: Throws \u0060NotSupportedException\u0060. \u0060canvas\u0060 is now a \u0060ScalingCanvas\u0060, which wraps a \u0060PlatformCanvas\u0060, which wraps an \u0060Andorid.Graphics.RecordingCanvas\u0060\r\n \r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nAll of the solutions above seem to be logical to me. Attempt 1 is clearly a bug and should work.\r\n\r\nAnd though attempts 2-4 also seem correct I cannot decide whether they are just not implemented yet or I misunderstood the design choices. Can you please clarify if they should work (maybe later on)?\r\n\r\n**Versions**\r\n* SkiaSharp: 2.88\r\n* Windows: Version 10.0.19044.1766\r\n* Android: Android 11.0 API 30 (emulated Pixel 5)\r\n* SkiaSharp.Views.Maui.Controls: 2.88.1-preview.79\r\n* Microsoft.Maui.Graphics.Skia: 6.0.403\r\n\r\n**Disclaimer**\r\n* I could not test MacOS and Linux\r\n* I know saving as .png \u002B \u0060PlatformImage.FromStream\u0060 would \u0022work\u0022 but unfortunately that is an unacceptable solution for me\r\n\r\n**Reproduction Link**\r\n\r\nSee the attachment. It now executes Attempt 1 but you can uncomment the other attempts, too.\r\n[MauiApp1.zip](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/files/9029277/MauiApp1.zip)\r\n",

After weeks of coding a graphics library to generate the images I want displayed on my maui page, I have hit a brick wall trying to get this last part to work.  I generate an SkBitmap and get the same crash when trying to use SkCanvasView and when trying to use the Maui Graphics view, I haven\u0027t been able to figure out how to render my skbitmap. trying with graphicsview says toplatformimage not supported.  This is very frustrating",

        "body": "Just an update from me, i have managed to fix the problem after long struggle,\r\nTo use SKCanvasView you need to configure this line in mauiprogram.cs in your project. Tell the maui to use skiasharp with this method\r\n**.UseSkiaSharp()**\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\nvar builder = MauiApp.CreateBuilder();\r\n            builder\r\n                .UseMauiApp\u003CApp\u003E()\r\n                .UseSkiaSharp()\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n                \r\nand for drawing bitmap, i believe it depends on what kind of bitmap data you have.\r\nfor ex: i had raw **rgba** data so i will be able to draw the bitmap with this code, here i am drawing it from byte array\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\nusing (var data = SKData.CreateCopy(_frameBuffer))\r\n            using (var original = new SKBitmap())\r\n            {\r\n                // create a new bitmap using the memory\r\n                original.InstallPixels(new SKImageInfo(_frameWidth, _frameHeight, SKColorType.Rgba8888), data.Data);\r\n                using (var resized = original.Resize(new SKImageInfo(canvasWidth, canvasHeight), SKFilterQuality.Medium))\r\n                {\r\n                    canvas.DrawBitmap(resized, 0, 0);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\nhere in this issue @mattleibow explained it nicely. https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/issues/603\r\n\r\nand for the .jpeg file that i have downloaded i can draw the bitmap like this.\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n using (var image = SKBitmap.Decode(_frameBuffer))\r\n            {\r\n                canvas.DrawBitmap(image, 0, 0);\r\n            }\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n            \r\nsome notes that i have found out while i am trying.\r\n\r\n- I couldn\u0027t use SKGLView it throws an error on maui, probably as a default, skcanvasview use gpu. But i am not sure about this\r\n- second thing is when i try to installpixels in this code\r\n\u0060original.InstallPixels(new SKImageInfo(_frameWidth, _frameHeight, SKColorType.Rgba8888), data.Data); \u0060\r\nif i do not define the type as Rgba8888, it loads the image with different format. Colors are kind of weird since it is a different format. But if i do not give the type in blazor with SKGLView it loads it succesfully, so i was stucked with that for a long time to find out the problem about weird colors.\r\n\r\nhope this can help someone. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
