  "body": "As followup from issue https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/issues/109.\n\nI think there are two possible solutions:\n1. Do the static linking for \u0060libSkiaSharp.dll\u0060 by default\n2. Provide separate package with statically linked \u0060libSkiaSharp.dll\u0060\n\nI vote for option No 1 as solves most of deployment issues, only downside is increased size of dll.\n",
