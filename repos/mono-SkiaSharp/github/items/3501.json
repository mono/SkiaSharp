  "body": "## Summary\n\nFixes consistency issues in the release-testing skill identified during skill-creator review.\n\n## Changes\n\n### Critical\n- **Require \u0060-wipe-data\u0060 for Android emulators** in setup.md (was missing, contradicted SKILL.md)\n- Add boot time note: fresh wipe takes 60-120s vs 15-30s without\n\n### Consistency\n- Standardize adb/emulator paths: use PATH (e.g., \u0060emulator\u0060) not full paths (\u0060$ANDROID_HOME/emulator/emulator\u0060)\n- Add PATH fallback note in setup.md for when tools aren\u0027t in PATH\n- Remove redundant \u0022Start Emulators First\u0022 section (duplicated Android Emulator Workflow)\n- Fix net9.0 \u2192 net8.0 to match actual project target framework\n\n## Context\n\nThese issues were found during the 3.119.2-preview.3 release testing when tests ran on the wrong emulator. The skill-creator skill was used to review release-testing for consistency and these fixes address the findings.",
