        "body": "Unfortunately not at this point. \r\n\r\nThere is a \u0060RGB 888x\u0060, but that is still 32-bit pixels. This is entirely dependent on the underlying skia. All color information is either 8, 16, 32 or 64-bits of information, so I do not see a case of 24-bit colors.\r\n\r\nHowever... If this is some encoded image file that you are trying to load, then it most probably can - just that it will be converted to an opaque BGRA8888 or RGBA8888 (depending on the platform)",
