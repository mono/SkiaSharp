  "body": "Hi! My first time using github to report :)\r\n\r\nI\u0027m experimenting with the method \u0022SKCanvasView.OnTouch\u0022 under UWP, and it seems like e.Handled is not working.\r\n\r\nI have a SKCanvasView inside a ListView item, and I want it to capture the input events, but they are propagated to the ListView item (and it gets animated and selected if I click in my SKCanvasView).\r\n\r\nAs I see [in this file](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/blob/master/source/SkiaSharp.Views.Forms/SkiaSharp.Views.Forms.UWP/SKTouchHandler.cs), it seems that the logic to stop the propagation is not implemented. The method \u0022CommonHandler\u0022 returns the value correctly, but the UWP events ignore it.\r\n\r\nAs I see in the UWP documentation, it should be copied to \u0022PointerRoutedEventArgs.Handled\u0022.\r\n\r\nAm I right or am I missing something?\r\n\r\nThank you!",

        "body": "@mchiz Thanks for reporting this. It is also a good bug since you did some investigation yourself :)\r\n\r\nI have a potential fix, see the attached NuGets. I now properly capture the pointer and all manipulation events when the mouse/finger is pressed. This will also prevent any other gestures from working if you have handled the pressed event until you release.\r\n\r\n[SkiaSharp.1.59.4-beta.nupkg](https://jenkins.mono-project.com/view/Components/job/Components-SkiaSharp/297/Azure/processDownloadRequest/ArtifactsFor-297/a554f9bb294a3c4e23fa3bc2d31cd26e77bb3892/output/SkiaSharp.1.59.4-beta.nupkg)\r\n[SkiaSharp.Views.1.59.4-beta.nupkg](https://jenkins.mono-project.com/view/Components/job/Components-SkiaSharp/297/Azure/processDownloadRequest/ArtifactsFor-297/a554f9bb294a3c4e23fa3bc2d31cd26e77bb3892/output/SkiaSharp.Views.1.59.4-beta.nupkg)\r\n[SkiaSharp.Views.Forms.1.59.4-beta.nupkg](https://jenkins.mono-project.com/view/Components/job/Components-SkiaSharp/297/Azure/processDownloadRequest/ArtifactsFor-297/a554f9bb294a3c4e23fa3bc2d31cd26e77bb3892/output/SkiaSharp.Views.Forms.1.59.4-beta.nupkg)\r\n\r\n",
