  "title": "SKCanvas.Clear handles alpha incorrectly",
  "body": "I just updated from version 1.59.2 to 1.60.0 and noticed a strange behavior with my OpenGL-accelerated surface. I want to clear the surface to 0, 0, 0, 0 (fully transparent), but it seems like the Clear operation now multiplies the color with the existing values rather than setting them, which effectively makes Clear() a no-op with my settings. It worked fine in 1.59.2, and still works fine with my CPU backend.",
