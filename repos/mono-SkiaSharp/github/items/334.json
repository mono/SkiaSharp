  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\ni am trying to implement finger painting on an SKCanvasView by building SKPaths from SKTouchAction.Moved events, which works perfectly when debugging in UWP. However, when debugging on a real Android device (or in an emulator), i only get a SKAction.Pressed event, never a SKTouchAction.Moved event.\r\n\r\nThe Canvas is not in a Scrollview, there are no Gesturehandlers attached anywhere near it.\r\n\r\nCan provide code if necessary.\r\n\r\nGreetings",
