  "title": "UWP platform does not behave the same as iOS and Android",
  "body": "I have a sample SkiaSharp app located on GitHub: https://github.com/scastria/SkiaDemo1\r\n\r\nIf I run the Layer Performance sample on Android and iOS, it works as expected. I can pinch and pan anywhere and when I click the reset toolbar button, it animates back to the Identity matrix.\r\n\r\nHowever, if I run the same Layer Performance sample on UWP, it does not work correctly. Whenever I click the reset toolbar button, it animates but the very last paint of the canvas is wrong and shows an incorrect result. If you click anywhere on the screen, it causes the color of the text to change which invalidates the surface 1 more time which then draws correctly.\r\n\r\nIt seems the code inside the Commit part of the Animation does not run correctly on UWP only. Any ideas?\r\n",
