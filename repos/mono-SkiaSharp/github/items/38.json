        "body": "Thanks for sharing your implementation @8 ! I\u0027ve also been looking at https://github.com/impsnldavid/skiasharpwpfextensions by @impsnldavid. I like how his solution is based on a SkiaControl which handles recreation of the WriteableBitmap when the control size changes and how it hides some of the plumping from the derived type where you put the actual drawing logic. \n\nI see you use the CompositionTarget for rendering but I am not sure which implementation is most performant. If you like, please take a look at https://github.com/impsnldavid/skiasharpwpfextensions and perhaps it gives you inspiration to evolve your solution. Maybe it is possible to combine the solutions and come up with an improvement.\n\nBy the way, your handle is awesome :)\n",
