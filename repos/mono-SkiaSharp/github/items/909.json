  "title": "[BUG] [iOS] SKCanvasView Touch Events interrupted by Xamarin.Forms Pan \u0026 Pinch Gestures",
  "body": "**Description**\r\n\r\nWhen adding touch events to an SKCanvasView that is contained within a Xamarin.Forms container that has pan an/or pinch gesture recognizers, iOS does not handle them correctly.\r\n\r\n**Code**\r\n\r\n[Sample application](https://github.com/codemode18/SkiaSharpPanPinchBugRepro) that reproduces the issue\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nThe sample code provided is a finger paint sample app, expected behavior is to show the path of the finger(s) as they are dragged across the screen\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\nOn iOS only, after a few pixels, the line stops drawing. If a Pan Gesture Recognizer is attached to the container, single finger drawing is incorrect. If a Pinch Gesture is attached, 2-finger drawing is incorrect. If both types of gesture recognizers are attached, both single and multi finger drawing are incorrect.\r\n\r\n**Basic Information**\r\n\r\n- Version with issue:  1.68\r\n- Last known good version:  \u003C!-- the version of SkiaSharp that still working --\u003E\r\n- IDE:  Visual Studio Platform Target Frameworks: \u003C!-- all that apply, remove the platforms that aren\u0027t broken or haven\u0027t had any testing --\u003E\r\n  - Android: N/A - iOS only\r\n  - iOS:  \u003C!-- the version of the iOS SDK you are compiling against, e.g. 11.1 --\u003E\r\n  - Linux:  \u003C!-- The version and distro of linux that you are building for, e.g. Ubuntu 16.04 --\u003E\r\n  - macOS:  \u003C!-- The version of macOS you are building for, e.g. 10.10 --\u003E\r\n  - Tizen:  \u003C!-- the version of the Tizen SDK you are compiling against, e.g. 4.0 --\u003E \r\n  - tvOS:  \u003C!-- the version of the tvOS SDK you are compiling against, e.g. 11.1 --\u003E\r\n  - UWP:  \u003C!-- the version of the UWP SDK you are compiling against, e.g. 16299 --\u003E \r\n  - watchOS:  \u003C!-- the version of the watchOS SDK you are compiling against, e.g. 11.1 --\u003E\r\n  - Windows Classic:  \u003C!-- the version of Windows you are building for, e.g. Windows 7 --\u003E\r\n- Target Devices:   \u003C!-- the devices that you noticed this on, e.g. iPhone X --\u003E\r\n  - \r\n  - \r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n\u003C!-- if the issue is a visual issue, please include screenshots showing the problem if possible --\u003E\r\n\r\n**Reproduction Link**\r\n\r\n\u003C!-- please upload or provide a link to a reproduction case --\u003E\r\n",
