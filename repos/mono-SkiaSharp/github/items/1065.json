  "title": "[FEATURE] Split the SkiaSharp.Views.Forms dll into a shared and a platform dll",
  "body": "In cases where platforms are not supported, the SkiaSharp.Views.Forms package used to allow the use of a netstandard dll. This caused issues when using the WPF package or any other packages we add in the future. (see #1011)\r\n\r\nAs a result of this issue, we moved the netstandard dll to ref-only as it was intended in #1012. The packages now work correctly (no longer crashes), but breaks in cases where JUST the netstandard dll was desired. (see #1047).\r\n\r\nTo solve this, we need 2 assemblies - 1 for the shared bits and 1 for the platform bits. Right now there is one, and this will either break as in #1011, or as in #1047 . If we split the assembly, then we can solve both issues.\r\n\r\nAlthough this may seem like a smaller issue, the code was originally designed to be a single dll and all the types are partially implemented in places. This is nice for a single dll, but not at all for split dlls.",
