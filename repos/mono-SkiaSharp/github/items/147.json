My code is based on _Skia.OSX.GLDemo_ sample, but I can\u0027t figure out why there is nothing on the screeen.\n\nHere is my code:\n[https://gist.github.com/Majchrzak/f9b2cb68df84d644a00c432e8ba13787](https://gist.github.com/Majchrzak/f9b2cb68df84d644a00c432e8ba13787)\n",

        "body": "@Majchrzak I am busy working on a set of Views/Layers to help speed up drawing with SkiaSharp. Right now I am busy getting everything together so the code is a quicksand, but here is the branch: https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/tree/skiasharp-views\n\nCheck out the \u0060views\u0060 folder in the root. Right now, the GL bits aren\u0027t there yet for Mac (I need to go to sleep, but when I wake... that is what I am going to do next). But, everything seems to be \u0022working\u0022 for iOS/tvOS (both raster and GL) and the raster stuff is there for Mac. As I said, it is still very much a work-in-progress.\n",
