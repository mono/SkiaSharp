        "body": "@migueldeicaza @joreg That is the \u0060Create\u0060 method. There is a constructor that is LTRB: https://developer.xamarin.com/api/constructor/SkiaSharp.SKRect.SKRect/p/System.Single/System.Single/System.Single/System.Single/\n\nI can\u0027t overload the constructor, but I wanted to do that as a helper method in case you are coming from some other rect object. I didn\u0027t want to force the user to calculate the LTRB when he had the XYWH coordinates.\n",
