  "body": "I followed [this tutorial](https://www.pshul.com/2018/02/01/xamarin-forms-interactive-svg-image-using-skiasharp-with-pan-and-zoom/) and managed successfully to load svg with pan and zoom. My svg image consists of many \u0060\u003Cpath\u003E\u0060 elements with \u0060data-*\u0060 attributes. I need to know which path was clicked and get their attribute, or at least just get the id attribute. Is there any way to do that?",

I don\u0027t think that SkiaSharp.Extended.Svg is going to get much love anytime soon - and it doesn\u0027t support understanding the image - it just draws it out. I think Svg.Skia probably has some APIs that you would want to use.",
