I really searched for days, but obviously overlooked this entry.\r\nIf I see it correctly, the current Maui CommunityToolkit versions require this WindowsSDK version, i.e. without a problem solution it is not possible to switch to current versions.\r\nQuestion to the great SkiaSharp team: When will there be a bug-fixed version?\r\nThank you very much for your great work.",
