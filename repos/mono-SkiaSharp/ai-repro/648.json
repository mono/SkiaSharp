All tests passed: large bitmap allocation succeeded, resize produced correct pixel content (not blank), and SKBitmap.FromImage worked without 'Unable to allocate pixels' error. The issue was filed in 2018 and labeled status/skia-update-required — maintainer confirmed it was an upstream Skia limitation. The bug appears to have been fixed in subsequent Skia updates. Note: reproduction used a synthetic test image (red background + blue rectangle), not the reporter's original camera JPEG, which may have had additional decoding challenges.",
