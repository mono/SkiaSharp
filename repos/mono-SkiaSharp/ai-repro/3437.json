  "notes": "The bug is Windows-specific and affects parallel SVG text rendering. Testing on macOS arm64 with .NET 8.0.417 confirms the bug does NOT reproduce on non-Windows platforms. The reporter explicitly confirmed Linux is also unaffected. The root cause is a data race in the DirectWrite font subsystem (Windows-specific) that causes GlyphsToUnichars to return empty values under concurrent access. FreeType (Linux) and Core Text (macOS) do not have this issue. To fully verify the bug, testing must be performed on Windows where DirectWrite is the font backend.",

    "Bug is Windows-specific due to DirectWrite font subsystem data race. Tested on macOS arm64 (Core Text font backend) — bug does not manifest. Reporter confirmed Linux (FreeType) is also unaffected. DirectWrite is only available on Windows. Workaround: Serialize SVG generation using SemaphoreSlim to ensure only one thread renders at a time."
