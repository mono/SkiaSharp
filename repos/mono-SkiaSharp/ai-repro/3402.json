  "notes": "Issue #3402 is a feature request for indexed color bitmap support (1bpp/2bpp/4bpp), not a bug report. There is no crash, exception, or incorrect behavior to reproduce. The requested functionality was intentionally removed from Skia upstream in 2017 (M61) and does not exist in SKColorType. Triage classification was correct. Bug reproduction does not apply to feature requests.",
