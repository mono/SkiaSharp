The reporter asks to replace the Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK metapackage dependency (v1.4.230913002) with the narrower Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK.WinUI sub-package (v1.8) in SkiaSharp.Views.WinUI. The factual claim was verified: both the source csproj and the published NuGet package (3.116.1) reference the full metapackage. Since there is no crash, exception, or wrong output to observe, no reproduction is possible — this is a dependency restructuring request.",
