  "notes": "The reported AccessViolationException occurs in NonAlertableWin32Lock.EnterCriticalSection, a Windows-only code path using Win32 CRITICAL_SECTION (Kernel32.dll P/Invoke). On macOS/Linux, SkiaSharp uses ReadWriteLock (managed ReaderWriterLockSlim) instead, which has no finalizer and cannot trigger this race condition. Created a standalone repro that deliberately leaks SKObjects to force finalizer cleanup — runs cleanly on macOS as expected since the vulnerable code path is Windows-only. Triage confirms this is a duplicate of #2194, fixed in v2.88.1 by PR #2195 which added null-checks before entering/leaving the CRITICAL_SECTION. The fix is verified present on main (PlatformLock.cs lines 123, 130). Reproducing the actual crash requires Windows.",
