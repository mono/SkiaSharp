  "notes": "Issue #607 requests SKTouchAction.Entered and SKTouchAction.Exited event support on iOS and Android. Source code inspection confirms the implementation gap: the Windows SKTouchHandler wires PointerEntered/PointerExited to SKTouchAction.Entered/Exited, and Tizen partially maps PointStateType.Leave to Exited, but the Apple (iOS/macOS) and Android SKTouchHandler classes only fire Pressed, Moved, Released, and Cancelled — they never emit Entered or Exited. Runtime verification of touch event behavior requires actual iOS and Android devices or emulators, which are not available in this environment.",
