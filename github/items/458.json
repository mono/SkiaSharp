  "title": "Update SKBitmap docs for removal of Lock/UnlockPixels",
  "body": "LockPixels() and UnlockPixels() have been removed in the latest SkiaSharp, but nearly all documentation about SKBitmap on the Internet still refers to them (as does the official SKBitmap.xml document itself). After wasting an hour this morning wondering what was going on (since I\u0027ve never used Skia before), and researching why even simple examples wouldn\u0027t compile, I added a note to the SKBitmap documentation that explains that these are no longer required operations, per discussion at https://bugs.chromium.org/p/skia/issues/detail?id=6481\u0026desc=2 .  I don\u0027t know if the \u0022note\u0022 I added is really the *correct* update for the documentation, but I sure would\u0027ve saved me a lot of time today if it had been included.  Feel free to alter its wording.",
