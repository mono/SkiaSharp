  "body": "It seems the SkSL has a public API, and had GPU and CPU backends. \r\n\r\nAlthough Google says it is likely to change a bit since it is under active development.\r\n\r\nSince back in the days even good old Silverlight had such a feature, I think it would make sense to expose it in SkiaSharp.\r\n\r\nIf so, I would be happy to make a PR.\r\n",
