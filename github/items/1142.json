  "title": "[QUESTION] Retain color in images with alpha of 0",
  "body": "I am using an SKSurface to plate several textures into a single image. These textures contain encoded non-color data in their alpha channel, which needs to be preserved in the plated image. However, when I create a snapshot of the surface and export it to a .png file, all areas with an alpha of 0 have their color values set to (0,0,0). Is it possible to prevent this from happening?\r\n\r\nColor channels as they should appear:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46323898/74379551-031f7000-4db6-11ea-8195-c0a38b509fd3.png)\r\n\r\nExported color channels (disregard difference in resolution, it\u0027s due to a difference in texture source):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46323898/74379611-1e8a7b00-4db6-11ea-8890-ca1bcfb71fe2.png)\r\n\r\nEdit: Build info, if needed:\r\n* Version: SkiaSharp 1.68.1.1\r\n* Building with: .NET core 3.1 CLI\r\n* Build target: win-x64\r\n* Target device: Windows 64-bit PC",
