  "body": "This pull request updates documentation and workflow instructions to improve clarity, consistency, and developer experience, with a focus on branch naming conventions, expanded build/test guidance, and enhanced bug-fixing workflows. It introduces several new reference documents for bug investigation and fixes, and clarifies the skill invocation and classification process for handling issues.\r\n\r\n**Branch Naming and Workflow Consistency:**\r\n\r\n- Standardizes the feature branch naming convention from \u0060dev/issue-NNNN-description\u0060 to \u0060copilot/issue-NNNN-description\u0060 (and similar for dependency updates) across all workflow and skill documentation, including command examples and checklists.
