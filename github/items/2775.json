  "body": "**Description of Change**\r\n\r\nThis is sort of inspired by #2664 but also the \u0060SKRunBuffer\u0060 API is a bit weird. In 2.x the skia comments say the text part is not meant to be sued, but it is actually required in some cases.\r\n\r\nI had cleaned up the API a bit before, but I see I still needed some work. \r\n\r\nThen #2664 was asking for less allocations, so I am thinking instead of spans, we just return the struct directly (almost) and then it is up to the caller to do the right thing. \r\n\r\n- Fixes https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/issues/2776",
