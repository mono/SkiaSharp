  "title": "[Windows, 3.0 Preview 3.1] Making an SKGLView visible (or a grid with SKGLView visible) sometimes flashes in gray / white",
  "body": "### Description\n\nSometimes on Windows, if you make an SKGLView visible, or a grid with SKGLView, visible (by changing IsVisible from false to true), the SKGLView randomly flashes in gray / white. This is probably caused by SwapChainPanel\u0027s base color being shown momentarily before the PaintSurface finishes drawing. By contrast, SKCanvasView and SKGLView on Android and iOS all work fine.\n\n### Code\n\nhttps://github.com/hyvanmielenpelit/GnollHack\r\n\r\nOn GamePage, CommandCanvas sometimes flashes if it uses SKGLView on Windows. I now changed it to use SKCanvasView on Windows.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen made visible by changing IsVisible to true, SKGLView does not flash in gray when made visible but displays the intended graphics, as per PaintSurface.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nWhen changing SKGLView\u0027s IsVisible to true, SKGLView sometimes flashes gray before drawing graphics specified in PaintSurface.\n\n### Version of SkiaSharp\n\n3.x (Alpha)\n\n### Last Known Good Version of SkiaSharp\n\nOther (Please indicate in the description)\n\n### IDE / Editor\n\nVisual Studio (Windows)\n\n### Platform / Operating System\n\nWindows\n\n### Platform / Operating System Version\n\nWindows 11\n\n### Devices\n\nWindows PC\n\n### Relevant Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant Log Output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project\u0027s Code of Conduct",
