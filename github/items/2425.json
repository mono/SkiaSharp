  "body": "**Description of Change**\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the Apple SDKs as we need to (we _should_ be) use the new Xcode and OS versions to compile as this really makes sure all the latest bits are being used. Apple will reject apps that are using older Xcode versions, and although we should not have any issues as we are only a library - it is best to just use the latest Apple things.\r\n\r\nSo the new **minimum** versions are:\r\n\r\n- Android: 16\r\n- iOS: 11 __(up from 8)__\r\n- Linux\r\n    - glibc/Debian: 9\r\n    - musl/Alpine: 3.9\r\n- Mac Catalyst 13.1 __(up from 13.0)__\r\n- macOS: 10.9 __(up from 10.8)__\r\n- Tizen: 4\r\n- tvOS: 9\r\n- UWP: 10.0.16299\r\n- WASM: 2.0.6\r\n- watchOS: 2\r\n- Windows: 7\r\n\r\nSome CPU architectures are now no longer supported:\r\n\r\n- iOS\r\n    - armv7 (arm32)\r\n    - i386 (x86)",
