  "body": "Please wrap the native method SkBitmap::setAlphaType()\r\nThere\u0027s currently no simple and fast way to add an alpha channel to a bitmap (e.g. after loading it from a file). Only solution I could think of was to copy the bitmap pixel by pixel, which takes about a second for larger ones.\r\n\r\nThanks.",
