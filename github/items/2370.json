  "title": "[QUESTION] Can SkiaSharp draw to an OpenGL buffer?",
  "body": "Can SkiaSharp draw to an OpenGL buffer created from .NET? It seems that it can, if the surface is constructed using the correct SKSurface.Create method. However, there are many overloads, and this process is not very straightforward. It would be useful to clarify which API to use. Additionally, a sample project in the samples directory using an easy library such OpenTK would be helpful to demonstrate the capability.\r\n",
