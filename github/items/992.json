  "body": "**Description of Change**\r\n\r\nThis PR is mainly for the addition and usage of a new p/invoke generator, but a little more:\r\n\r\n - The extra work to map the C API to the internal C# API is unnecessary and can be automated. It most often just involves copying the structs and enums across - and then renaming them. Same with the imports, just a matter of copying and fixing up the C-isms.  \r\n   The new generator will be able to do all this work for us, leaving us to focus on a nice C API, and then wrap the generated C# with a beautiful, user-friendly API.\r\n   And, there will be less mistakes because I won\u0027t forget to change member types/names when copying similar code :)\r\n - Also start splitting the build for the native into separate architectures. Instead of building all 4 Windows arches in serial and taking hours, build them in parallel in less than 1 hour.\r\n\r\n**Bugs Fixed**\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**API Changes**\r\n\r\nShould be none.\r\n\r\n**Behavioral Changes**\r\n\r\nShould be none.\r\n\r\n**PR Checklist**\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has tests (if omitted, state reason in description)\r\n- [ ] Rebased on top of master at time of PR\r\n- [ ] Changes adhere to coding standard\r\n- [ ] Updated documentation\r\n",
