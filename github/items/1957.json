  "body": "**Description of Change**\r\n\r\nIt appears that the workload installer randomly selects a feed to use to download packages.\r\n\r\nI think I got a case where a version existed on both feeds - but as part of a separate build - one of which was signed and the other not.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes sure that if it is not a preview version of .NET, then it does not use the preview version of the workloads.",
