  "body": "Hey team,\r\n\r\nI\u0027m trying to get SkiaSharp running in a .NET Core web app, but I\u0027m getting an exception: \r\n\r\n\u003E Unable to load DLL \u0027libSkiaSharp\u0027: This operation is only valid in the context of an app container. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x8007109A)\r\n\r\nI\u0027ve made sure that I have the C\u002B\u002B redistributable installed based on the other DLL loading issue mentioned elsewhere. I\u0027ve tried this in netcoreapp1.0, netcoreapp1.1 and netcoreapp2.0, as well as with several versions of the SkiaSharp package to no avail. I have posted a simple example that always fails [to this repo](https://github.com/drayfar/SkiaTest/blob/master/src/SkiaTest/Program.cs). Any guidance?",
