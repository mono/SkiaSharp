  "body": "I use the CanvasSize to calculate the scaling from Forms independent coordinates to device dependent coordinates. But if I try to get the CanvasSize in OnSizeChanged, it is always (0, 0), or better, is the last size of the view. It seems, that I have to check for a change in OnPaintSurface. But I don\u0027t want to check this each 16 ms, because it doesn\u0027t change without a OnSizeChanged event.\r\n\r\nSo the question is: Is there an event to get the correct CanvasSize?",
