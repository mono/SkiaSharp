  "body": "**Description of Change**\r\n\r\nI have add Span overloads to many methods that previously only accepted Arrays, IntPtrs, or Strings.\r\n\r\nSome methods could not be given span overloads because the Array/Strings must be marshaled as null-terminated types. This _could_ be solved by copying the contents of the span into a rented array and filling the rest of the array with \u0060null\u0060, however I wanted to discuss this change before making it.\r\n\r\n_The next changes aren\u0027t strictly related to converting to spans, but I figured they were related enough to include them here. If not, I can move them to a new PR._\r\n\r\nI changed a few \u0060return new T[0]\u0060 to \u0060return Array.Empty\u003CT\u003E ()\u0060 to reduce pointless allocations. As far as I can tell, this does not change the behaviour of dereferencing a pointer to the array.\r\n\r\nI also changed the algorithm of \u0060implicit operator SKRuntimeEffectUniform (float[][] value)\u0060 to make allocations linearly associated with the length of \u0060value\u0060 rather than using a variable length list.\r\n\r\nLastly, I believe I fixed 4 memory leaks in \u0060SKCanvas.DrawVertices\u0060, swapped out 3 \u0060SKTypeFace.ToFont\u0060 calls to \u0060SKTypeFace.GetFont\u0060 in \u0060SKTypeFace.GetGlyphs\u0060, and fixed a potential(?) nullptr dereference in \u0060SKPath.GetPoints\u0060. If any changed behaviour occurs in those methods as a result, that might have been my fault.\r\n\r\n\u003C!-- Describe your changes here. --\u003E\r\n\r\n**Bugs Fixed**\r\n\r\n- Related to #2616 \r\n\r\n\u003C!-- Provide links to issues here.
