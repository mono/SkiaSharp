  "body": ".NET Standard 1.3 is an ancient TFM and all the frameworks it supports and .NET Standard 2.0 doesn\u0027t, are legacy (with the exception of UWP earlier than 10.0.16299, ~~which might matter if you want to support LTSC versions of Windows 10~~ no it doesn\u0027t, you target UWP explicitly).\r\n\r\nTo ease maintainability and enable newer framework features without \u0060#ifdef\u0060s, you should consider dropping support for .NET Standard 1.3 in SkiaSharp.",
