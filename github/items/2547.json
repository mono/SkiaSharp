  "body": "**Description of Change**\r\n\r\nThis PR is the main set of changes to update to the latest \u0022stable\u0022 chrome milestone: **\u0060115\u0060**\r\n\r\nThere are going to be several major breaking changes in this PR, but we will re-evaluate them all again once we are fully operational. The https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/issues/2544 issue will track that part. Any APIs that are still needed and are within reason will be added in that work. This PR is going to aim for the most up-to-date and the as-clean-as-possible change.\r\n\r\n**Bugs Fixed**\r\n\r\n- Fixes #2543\r\n\r\n\u003C!-- Provide links to issues here. Ensure that a GitHub issue was created for your feature or bug fix before sending PR. --\u003E\r\n\r\n**API Changes**\r\n\r\nThis was a large set of changes, both to the code as well as to new requirements.
