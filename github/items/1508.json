  "body": "We have a Xamarin App targeting Android and iOS, we are trying to reduce the size of our deployable. SkiaSharp is the single biggest thing in our deployment. \r\n\r\nWe don\u0027t need GPU or PDF support, so it would be good if we could get a build of SkiaSharp that doesn\u0027t have these things. I\u0027m not sure how much space this will save, but if it is significant it could be quite an improvement for us.",
