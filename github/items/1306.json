  "body": "Over at oxyplot we are facing a kind of strange [issue](https://github.com/oxyplot/oxyplot/issues/1573) with our \u0060SkiaRenderContext\u0060, which is based on SkiaSharp 1.68.1.1.\r\n\r\n### High-Level Issue\r\n\r\nBasically, inside \u0060SkiaRenderContext\u0060, we are [caching](https://github.com/oxyplot/oxyplot/blob/7329013d6f48331e42b81c4315cd13fb5a82bb8f/Source/OxyPlot.SkiaSharp/SkiaRenderContext.cs#L845) instances of \u0060SKTypeface\u0060 to reuse them during the rendering operation. This works fine in general. The problem arises when we create and dispose a second instance of \u0060SkiaRenderContext\u0060, which during its disposal will [dispose](https://github.com/oxyplot/oxyplot/blob/7329013d6f48331e42b81c4315cd13fb5a82bb8f/Source/OxyPlot.SkiaSharp/SkiaRenderContext.cs#L473) all the cached fonts it used. From that point on, the text rendering of the first \u0060SkiaRenderContext\u0060 will be broken, even though this was never disposed itself.\r\n\r\n_(The use case here could be: export a plot using one of the SkiaSharp-based exporters while displaying the plot in a SkiaSharp-based PlotView)_\r\n\r\n### Repro\r\n\r\nI managed to reproduce the issue using the following minimized example:\r\n\r\n        public void TestTypefaceDisposal()\r\n        {\r\n            using var bitmap = new SKBitmap(100, 60);\r\n            using var canvas = new SKCanvas(bitmap);\r\n            canvas.Clear(SKColors.White);\r\n\r\n            var minimumRenderContext = new MinimumRenderContext();\r\n\r\n            // this draws correctly\r\n            minimumRenderContext.DrawText(new SKPoint(20, 20), \u0022OxyPlot\u0022, canvas);\r\n\r\n            // create and dispose a completely unrelated SKTypeface instance\r\n            SKTypeface.FromFamilyName(\u0022Courier New\u0022).Dispose();\r\n\r\n            // this does NOT render correctly\r\n            minimumRenderContext.DrawText(new SKPoint(20, 40), \u0022OxyPlot\u0022, canvas);\r\n\r\n            using var fileStream = File.OpenWrite(\u0022test.png\u0022);\r\n            using var skStream = new SKManagedWStream(fileStream);\r\n            SKPixmap.Encode(skStream, bitmap, SKEncodedImageFormat.Png, 0);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        private class MinimumRenderContext\r\n        {\r\n            private SKTypeface cachedTypeFace;\r\n\r\n            public void DrawText(SKPoint point, string text, SKCanvas canvas)\r\n            {\r\n                this.cachedTypeFace ??= SKTypeface.FromFamilyName(\u0022Courier New\u0022);\r\n                using var paint = new SKPaint() { Typeface = this.cachedTypeFace };\r\n                canvas.DrawText(text, point, paint);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n### Expected Result\r\n\r\nI would expect both lines to be identically rendered in Courier New. \r\n\r\n### Actual Result\r\n\r\nThis code above gives the following output in \u0060test.png\u0060:\r\n![test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18097859/82657436-a558ba80-9c25-11ea-886c-9bbbcb4b7694.png)\r\n\r\nObviously the second line is rendered in a different font. Depending on the circumstances, this can have more serious effects including missing glyphs.\r\n\r\nIt seems that disposing a \u0060SKTypeface\u0060 instance can break other existing instances that share the same font family, weight etc.\r\n\r\nIs this a bug? Or am I just not supposed to cache \u0060SKTypeface\u0060 instances? I did not find any documentation suggesting that, and I read somewhere that caching is recommended for performance, though I can\u0027t find the source atm...\r\n",
