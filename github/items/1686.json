  "title": "[QUESTION] Reading 24-bit Netpbm (PPM, PGM) Image With SkiaSharp",
  "body": "Is there any way to parse a 24-bit RGB image with Skiasharp? I have an image in a byte array in PPM format which is a 24-bit RGB image format: 24 bits per pixel: 8 for red, 8 for green, 8 for blue. There is no alpha channel so reading this as a 32-bit ARGB or BGRA will not read properly. \r\n\r\nI have not been successful in reading this image with a SKBitmap. Is there a better class in SkiaSharp to read this image format with or a way to parse it and display it?\r\n\r\nMore info on the PPM format:\r\n\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm",
