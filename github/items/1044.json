  "body": "**Description of Change**\r\n\r\nAll the assemblies are required to be in the ref folder as if there is any ref folder, it will take precedence over the lib folder. In the case where we have JUST the netstandard library in the ref, that is used for ALL platforms. Even though the correct assembly is swapped out at compile time, we actually have more things inside the assembly for the platforms.\r\n\r\n**Bugs Fixed**\r\n\r\n- Fixes #1042\r\n\r\n**API Changes**\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n**Behavioral Changes**\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n**PR Checklist**\r\n\r\n- [x] Has tests (if omitted, state reason in description)\r\n- [x] Rebased on top of master at time of PR\r\n- [x] Changes adhere to coding standard\r\n- [x] Updated documentation\r\n",
