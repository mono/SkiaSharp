  "title": "[FEATURE] Missing image codecs when moving from deprecated System.Drawing.Common",
  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nThe .NET team contacted us regarding the deprecation of System.Drawing.Common on non-windows platforms from .NET 6 and recommended SkiaSharp as a possible replacement. See [this issue](https://github.com/EPPlusSoftware/EPPlus/issues/495). Looking at SkiaSharp I notice that it is missing a few of the image codecs supported by System.Drawing.Common in Windows.\r\n- tif\r\n- emf\r\n- wmf\r\n\r\nI work on [EPPlus](https://github.com/EPPlusSoftware/EPPlus) which uses System.Drawing.Common for imaging and font measuring today. Even though these formats might be considered legacy, they are supported and used by Excel and other Office products.\r\nEmf is for example used when rendering all ActiveX controls in Office.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you\u0027d like**\r\n\r\nImplement codecs supported by System.Drawing.Common.\r\nNative support for svg would also be nice.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you\u0027ve considered**\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n\r\n",
