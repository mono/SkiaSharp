  "body": "I\u0027m looking into SkiaSharp for generating images from an ASP.NET Core back-end. \r\n\r\nI have some logo images that will be used multiple times. Is it possible keep references to SKImage and SKBitmap and draw the same instance onto multiple SKCanvas instances? Will I hit threading/locking issues?  \r\n\r\nA lot of the SK* based objects implement IDisposable. Lets say I create an SKPaint and draw a line onto an SKCanvas. Do I have to dispose of the SKPaint, or will that happen automatically when I dispose of the SKSurface that I got the SKCanvas from? ",
