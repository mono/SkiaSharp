  "title": "iOS: no touch.exit event fired",
  "body": "When overriding the OnTouch function in iOS, and the touch moves outside the view, there is never any touch event fired. Thus, it\u0027s impossible to tell if the finger has been released or not.\r\n\r\nThis is a Xamarin.Forms project and I do not see this problem in Android or UWP.\r\n\r\nMy view is inside a Master-Detail page, so it\u0027s possible that the Master-Detail hijacked the touch event, but then we should get a touch-cancelled event. I\u0027ll see if I have time to create a reproduction later this week, but it\u0027s pretty simple to create.\r\n\r\n",
