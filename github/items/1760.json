  "body": "**Description of Change**\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the Mac Catalyst native component to the packages.\r\n\r\nPreviously this was having issues with the fact that the native framework has symlinks and .NET does not know how to handle that. It would end up duplicating files and then Xcode would not understand.\r\n\r\nThere are currently 2 issues that still affect this, and thus targets are required to patch it up a bit:\r\n - https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/issues/11667\r\n - https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/issues/12369\r\n\r\n**Bugs Fixed**\r\n\r\n - None\r\n\r\n**API Changes**\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n**Behavioral Changes**\r\n\r\nCode that would throw at runtime now does not.\r\n\r\n**PR Checklist**\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has tests (if omitted, state reason in description)\r\n- [ ] Rebased on top of main at time of PR\r\n- [ ] Changes adhere to coding standard\r\n- [ ] Updated documentation\r\n",
