  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nCurrently, the \u0060IgnorePixelScaling\u0060 property works backwards. It draws the image and then scales it up.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you\u0027d like**\r\nThe property should create the large canvas, but then apply scaling so that further drawing operations are scaled automatically.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nRelated: https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/issues/527\r\n",
