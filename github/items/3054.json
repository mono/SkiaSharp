  "body": "**Description of Change**\r\n\r\nIt appears that most of the older (\u003C 6.0) tools have been removed from the \u0022latest\u0022 package manager, so we need to use the snapshots.\r\n\r\nSee more: https://developer.tizen.org/blog/announcing-tizen-studio-6.0-release\r\n\r\n\u003E Added Tizen 9.0 profile and deprecated all Tizen profiles below 6.0.\r\n\r\n_I have a feeling this may have been an error since some of the web tools are still there and the wording is \u0022deprecated\u0022. But, either way, this will be more consistent for this old branch._",
