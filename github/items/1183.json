  "body": "It seems Google removed the \u0060TextOnPath\u0060 functionality:\r\n\r\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/skia-discuss/drawTextOnPath%7Csort:date/skia-discuss/971LXXfT1o0/pamVf88uAQAJ\r\n\r\nWe actually need this function, but just like SVG, need more functionality, we want to provide the offsets of the glyphs on the path ourselves.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have a pure C# implementation of TextOnPath, maybe with the extra SVG features?\r\n\r\nAlso, will future versions of SkiaSharp still contain \u0060TextOnPath\u0060, and is an extra overload with \u0060float[] hOffsets\u0060  something that could be included? If so, I could make a PR for this.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nPeter\r\n\r\n",
