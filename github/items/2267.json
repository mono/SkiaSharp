  "body": "        @mattleibow just a heads up... that Blazor skiasharp views are broken under dotnet 7.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/blob/main/source/SkiaSharp.Views.Blazor/SkiaSharp.Views.Blazor/wwwroot/SKHtmlCanvas.ts#L114\r\n\r\nThis GL symbol is not in scope.\r\n\r\nDont quote me on this, but my conclusion from spending a day investigating is:\r\n\r\nnet 6, ES6 modules are not used: GL is a global variable.\r\n\r\nnet7 dotnet.js is using ES6 modules, and GL is now private and isnt exported.\r\n\r\nsomething generates the js code for the GL stuff and stuffs it in (dotnet.js). I am unable to determine the thing that generates this source thus far.\r\n\r\nfor now ill continue to find a workaround, but maybe you know something ?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/76077\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @danwalmsley in https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/issues/2254#issuecomment-1256289355_\r\n      ",
