  "body": "**Description of Change**\r\n\r\nSometimes it\u0027s useful to pass an array of points to \u0060SKCanvas.DrawPoints\u0060 but not to draw all of them.  The API currently doesn\u0027t accept Spans\u003CT\u003E at this point, so it is a stop-gap until that decision has been made.\r\n\r\nNo tests added currently as there is not currently a test in the \u0060tests/Tests/SkiaSharp/SKCanvasTest.cs\u0060 file for drawing points.\r\n\r\n**Bugs Fixed**\r\n\r\n- Fixes #2986\r\n\r\n**API Changes**\r\n\r\nAdd \u0060public void SKCanvasDrawPoints (SKPointMode mode, SKPoint[] points, int count, SKPaint paint)\u0060 overload.\r\n\r\n**Behavioral Changes**\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n**Required skia PR**\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n**PR Checklist**\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has tests (if omitted, state reason in description)\r\n- [x] Rebased on top of main at time of PR\r\n- [ ] Merged related skia PRs\r\n- [x] Changes adhere to coding standard\r\n- [ ] Updated documentation\r\n",
