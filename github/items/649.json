  "title": "Can Skiasharp be used for Inking Scalable drawings",
  "body": "Hi,\r\nI currently have a uwp app which uses the InkCanvas from UWP combined with Win2D.\r\n\r\nIn this way the user can draw with pen or touch input. The drawings are scalable like SVG. I cannot port this UWP to Xamarin because InkCanvas is not recognized by Xamarin, so I wonder if I can convert my code to use Skiasharp. Hence my question: Does Skiasharp supports pen input for vector graphics to be drawnd directly on their tablets?\r\nThank you for your advice it will surely help.\r\n",
