  "body": "I\u0027m trying to determine which shapes are located by coordinates (mouse click).\r\n\r\nI realized that skia does not provide such an API and I need to implement it myself, but I have no ideas on this.\r\n\r\nEverything is complicated by the fact that I need to understand exactly that the click occurred on the figure, and not its square hitbox, for example, I can click inside the text with the number \u00220\u0022 and this should not be considered a hit, there are also rectangles with rounded edges, complex curves, different shapes, and there are thousands of them on the canvas\r\n\r\nI will be grateful for any advice because right now I don\u0027t even know how to Google for a solution to my problem",
