  "body": "Hi!\n\nI am currently replacing my Android Canvas API stuff with SkiaSharp as I am hoping for better performance.\nOne problem I am facing is that the implementation of SKMatrix is rather dumb.\nIt would be sufficient, if it was at least possible \n1) to concatenate two matrices like\nSKMatrix SKMatrix.Concat(SKMatrix m1, SKMatrix m2);\n\n2) and to get the inverse of a specified matrix\nSKMatrix SKMatrix.MakeInverse(SKMatrix other);\n\nthese two basic methods would solve almost all of my matrix calculations!\nThank you for considering this :)\n",
