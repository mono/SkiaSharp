  "body": "**Description**\r\n\r\nIf the Lottie json file contains embedded resources, such as an image as a data URI \u0060data:image/png;base64\u0060, then it just skips over it.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is that Skottie uses a concept of a \u0060ResourceProvider\u0060 to decode images/fonts/audio. By default, it does not set up and providers. There are a few providers implemented, so we just have to expose those.\r\n\r\n[dotnet_bot.zip](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/files/9123532/dotnet_bot.zip)\r\n",
