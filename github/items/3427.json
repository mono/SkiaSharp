  "body": "**Description of Change**\r\n\r\n\u003C!-- Describe your changes here. --\u003E\r\nIn JavaScript methods, return early when the target element is no longer present in the DOM, and remove the related error log for this scenario.\r\n\r\nIn Blazor, elements can be removed from the DOM before a component\u2019s Dispose() method is invoked. This means that after any async call, the corresponding DOM element may already have been removed due to navigation. There\u2019s no reliable way to distinguish whether a missing element is due to normal component disposal or an actual logic error. This change updates the code to simply stop execution when the element is absent and suppress error logging for this case.\r\n\r\nRef: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/45777\r\n\r\n**Bugs Fixed**\r\n\r\n- Fixes #\r\n\r\n\u003C!-- Provide links to issues here.
