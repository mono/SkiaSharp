  "body": "Hi!\r\n\r\nI\u0027m new to Skia and try to use it for some pixel-manipulations on my LED-Matrix on a Raspberry Pi.\r\n\r\nI would like to know if there\u0027s an easy way to copy one (smaller) bitmap into another (larger) bitmap at a given location.\r\n\r\nSo lets say I have two bitmaps:\r\n\r\n\u0060var entireBitmap = new SKBitmap(64, 32);\r\nvar smallBitmap = new SKBitmap(16,8);\u0060\r\n\r\nNow I want to copy the entire \u0027smallBitmap\u0027 into the \u0027entireBitmap\u0027 at let\u0027s say x = 12, y= 18.\r\n\r\nI think I could do it using GetPixel and SetPixel but thats slow and needs some calculations so I think maybe theres a better way?!\r\n\r\nIt should also accept negative location coordinates and tolerate overlapping if the smaller bitmap goes beyond the height or width of the entire bitmap.\r\n\r\nSometing like SKBitmap.CopyTo(entireBitmap, smallBitmap, x, y);\r\n\r\nThanks and regards\r\nJan",
