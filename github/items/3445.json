  "body": "This pull request introduces a comprehensive \u0022implement-issue\u0022 skill for SkiaSharp GitHub issues, along with detailed workflow documentation and supporting reference guides for new APIs, bug fixes, and context gathering. It also improves the onboarding experience and build documentation by clearly stating prerequisites and providing updated, step-by-step build instructions for all major platforms.\r\n\r\n**Skill and Workflow Documentation**\r\n\r\n* Added \u0060.github/skills/implement-issue/SKILL.md\u0060 to define a structured workflow for implementing SkiaSharp GitHub issues, including steps for context gathering, classification, planning, and ABI safety checks.\r\n* Added reference guides for:\r\n  - Bug fix implementation, including common patterns and regression testing (\u0060references/bug-fix.md\u0060).\r\n  - New API implementation, with patterns and ABI safety reminders (\u0060references/new-api.md\u0060).\r\n  - Context gathering checklist for all issue types (\u0060references/context-checklist.md\u0060).\r\n\r\n**Build and Contribution Documentation Improvements**\r\n\r\n* Added clear prerequisites (such as .NET 8 SDK and MAUI workload) to \u0060documentation/README.md\u0060, \u0060documentation/building.md\u0060, and \u0060CONTRIBUTING.md\u0060 to help new contributors get started.
