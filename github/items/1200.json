  "body": "**Description of Change**\r\n\r\nResolve some concurrency issues. In some cases the construction and/or destruction overlap and this causes invalid states. This PR improves the locking to avoid this, but still preserves the read and write level of locking.\r\n\r\nIt also includes a few other improvements, such as making sure objects that require their \u0022parent\u0022 object to not be GC\u0027ed add a reference to it. In most cases it is simple, such as a canvas being owned by a surface. But, in the case of a pixmap, the ownership is a little different in that they are copies, but actually require the parent object to stick around. So, the ownership is \u0022reversed\u0022.\r\n\r\nThere is also a few other tweaks to improve general GC reliability/interop performance.\r\n\r\n**Bugs Fixed**\r\n\r\n- Fixes #1188\r\n- Resolves underlying issue for #1121 #910 #1173 #1168 #1144\r\n- Resolves the underlying issue for the need for #1180\r\n\r\n**API Changes**\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n**Behavioral Changes**\r\n\r\nLess crashes due to correct object management.\r\n\r\n**PR Checklist**\r\n\r\n- [x] Has tests (if omitted, state reason in description)\r\n- [x] Rebased on top of master at time of PR\r\n- [x] Changes adhere to coding standard\r\n- [x] Updated documentation\r\n",
