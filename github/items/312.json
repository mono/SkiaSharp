  "body": "For most users of the common linux distros (Ubuntu, Debian, Red Hat, OpenSUSE, etc) it may be possible to distribute a binary in the NuGet package.\r\n\r\nThere are some limitations and reason why this is not such a good idea, but this is just an issue to track this thought.\r\n\r\nJust want to link the main, but old, linux issue: https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/issues/90\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo make life easier for everyone, I moved code around and added a new target to the GN files. Now, the native libSkiaSharp build is done with GN and ninja directly: https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/wiki/Building-on-Linux",
