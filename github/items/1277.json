  "body": "**Description of Change**\r\n\r\nSome work into improving performance of object creation and disposal. On average as simple create-dispose operation is 2.84x faster:\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060cs\r\nnew SKPaint().Dispose()\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\nThis is almost 3x faster, and just using a single thread, one object at a time. The perf improvements will come for a few reasons:\r\n - some objects do not need to be added/located in a dictionary\r\n - reduced dictionary operations improves perf for other objects that are in the dictionary\r\n - the commonly used objects are not added\r\n\r\n**Bugs Fixed**\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n**API Changes**\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n**Behavioral Changes**\r\n\r\nSome objects no longer are stored in the the global dictionary. This is not a user-visible change.\r\n\r\n**PR Checklist**\r\n\r\n- [x] Has tests (if omitted, state reason in description)\r\n- [x] Rebased on top of master at time of PR\r\n- [x] Changes adhere to coding standard\r\n- [x] Updated documentation\r\n",
