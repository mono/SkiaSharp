  "title": "[FEATURE] Support new color mapping api",
  "body": "### Is your feature request related to a problem?\n\nSkia dropped colormap support for some reason\n\n### Describe the solution you would like\n\nPlease supply alternative for mapping true color images to a linear color array.\r\n\r\nIt would be a way to map a true color image to a 32 bit index in a color array.\r\nThen it could be shifted and drawn remapped to the palette.\r\n\r\nTo make it clear this is 3 parts.\r\n1. A api to quantization rgba SKBitmaps to a 32 bit indexed SKBitmaps\r\n2. A api to shift color quantization palettes\r\n3. A api to draw it back to a palette mapped rgba SKBitmap\r\n\r\n\n\n### Describe alternatives you have considered\n\nI tried using avalonia ui WriteableBitmaps but they are too slow.\n\n### Additional context\n\nBy 32 bit indexed image I mean it would still technically be a rgba image but the integer representation of the color would be used as the index to the color palette.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project\u0027s Code of Conduct",
