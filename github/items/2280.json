  "body": "**Description**\r\n\r\nWe\u0027re using SkiaSharp to resize our images. For most images, it works just fine. But for some images it rotates them in addition to resizing them, which is undesirable. The rotation is automatic.\r\n\r\n**Code**\r\n\r\nCode is long. I have attached an image that has this problem.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nIt should resize images, without automatically rotating them.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\nIt resizes images, and for some images it automatically rotates them too.\r\n\r\nSince it happens for all version on all operating systems (we have tested Windows and Linux), thus we just provide one image that has this problem. Please test this image.\r\n\r\n![random](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81751123/194540687-d2b259c9-a53f-4079-a70a-754198de8ef9.jpeg)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
