  "body": "I would like contribute to SkiaSharp, providing PRs. \r\n\r\nThe main [SkiaSharp readme](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp#building-skiasharp) only mentions building both the managed and native code.\r\n\r\nThe wiki still has a guideline of how to build the managed code only, but I can\u0027t get this working (with vs2019, on Windows).\r\n\r\nIs it still possible to build only the managed code from the cloned SkiaSharp source code?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot,\r\nPeter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
