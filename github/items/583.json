  "body": "I\u0027d like to build a skia sharp library file (dynamic/shared) that will only be used for Font rendering, thus reducing the size of my program\u0027s dependencies. However, I am unable to find a way to configure Skia Sharp to only include certain parts of it and would like to know if there is any guide I can follow for this.",
