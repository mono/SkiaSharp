  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nHi there, I am having issue with clear operation in SkiaSharp. \r\nI decoded the image as a bitmap on the canvasView, users able to make image annotation. I wanted to implement something to clear all the annotation on the canvas (not the image), but it does not work. It cleared all the canvas and left a blank white canvas.\r\nI would like to know is there any clues to do this?\r\nIs it possible to place two canvas views on XAML? One is for the image bitmap, and another one is for drawing on the image.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance.\r\n\r\n### Basic Information\r\n\r\n- SkiaSharp version on Xamarin NuGet: 1.60.3\r\n- IDE:  Visual Studio 2017 \r\n- Platform Target Frameworks: \u003C!-- all that apply, remove the platforms that aren\u0027t broken or haven\u0027t had any testing --\u003E\r\n  - Android: Android 5.5 - API 22 \r\n\r\n- Target Devices:\r\n  -   Android Emulator\r\n\r\n",
