  "title": "[WIP] Changes for .NET Core v1.1.1",
  "body": "The main changes were to do with the final v1.1.1 version of .NET Core:\r\n - strong naming was not really supported on non-Windows, so they disabled it with an error\r\n    - I now sign on Windows\r\n    - I now verify that the .dll is signed before packing the NuGet\r\n - the new version dropped support for the test runner stuff\r\n    - I created a test runner app\r\n    - it is better since I can test the .NET Core publish\r\n - can\u0027t update to Cake v0.18.0 as this has issues with UWP apps\r\n - improved CI detection and features\r\n - fixes for Linux color tests (just the tests were dodgy)",
