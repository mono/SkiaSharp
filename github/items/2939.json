  "body": "### Is your feature request related to a problem?\n\nThe skia-python equivalent is in:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/kyamagu/skia-python/blob/e0b030c14e33f70880cfcc502eaeed898a77fc3c/src/skia/main.cpp#L82\r\n\r\nEither provide that as a extra /optional call, or put it in SkiaSharp somewhere during load-time, one off, as in skia-python. The line switches on OT-SVG colour font support within skia.\r\n\r\nYou might need to add a little to your libskiasharp.so process, but ask me if you encounter problems. (I am the one who put that line in skia-python).\r\n\r\nAnd possibly reference this shell script for skia build options:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/HinTak/skia-building-fun/blob/main/download-and-build-skia.sh\n\n### Describe the solution you would like\n\nSupport ot-svg colour fonts\n\n### Describe alternatives you have considered\n\nThis is an obscure and new part of skia\u0027s api (since m103 or thereabouts, I believe), it unlikely you have already bound it yet.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project\u0027s Code of Conduct",
