  "body": "**Description of Change**\r\n\r\nCurrently, \u0060dotnet build\u0060 and \u0060dotnet test\u0060 will fail because \u0060CodeTaskFactory\u0060 is not supported (https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/issues/2890) I have switched to using simple MSBuild properties to do the same work. This will have the benefit of allowing the .NET Core tests to be run with \u0060dotnet test\u0060 instead of first building the NuGets.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I have switched to using the new stages feature of DevOps. This makes the process a bit easier and will allow for extensions into the release pipline.\r\n\r\n**Bugs Fixed**\r\n\r\nMaintainence.\r\n\r\n**API Changes**\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n**Behavioral Changes**\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n**PR Checklist**\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has tests (if omitted, state reason in description)\r\n- [ ] Rebased on top of master at time of PR\r\n- [ ] Changes adhere to coding standard\r\n- [ ] Updated documentation\r\n",
