  "title": "[QUESTION] Question about SkiaSharp NuGet package.",
  "body": "Why there are both runtimes\\osx and lib\\Xamarin.Mac20? I mean Xamarin.Mac can be covered by .NET Standard and the appropriate runtime - looks like duplication. Correct me if I am wrong. The same applies to other Xamarin libraries provided in the package. Will not it be more correct to provide .NET Standard library and appropriate native skia libraries in runtimes?\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/standard/blob/master/docs/versions.md\r\nAccording to the table .NET Standard 1.3 covers Xamarin.iOS 10.0 and higher, Xamarin.Android 7.0 and higher and Xamarin.Mac 3.0 and higher. Is not the purpose of .NET Standard to share code between all these platforms?\r\n",
