  "body": "Adds a exclusion files for CredScan and PoliCheck to ignore third party\r\nsources and a mathematical term used as a variable name in number of\r\nplaces. The versions of the compliance and reporting tasks used have\r\nalso been updated.\r\n\r\nThe new \u0060source.gdnsuppress\u0060 file is used to exclude specific terms from\r\nPoliCheck, as the \u0060PoliCheckExclusions.xml\u0060 file does not allow very\r\ngranular control. This file is generated and uploaded by the build, and\r\nthe generated file can be used to update the in-tree file to exclude\r\nmore terms in the future as needed.",
