  "title": "[Android, 3.116.1] SKGLView touch events are not on the main thread on Android",
  "body": "### Description\n\nOn Android, SKGLView Touch events are not raised on the main thread. I don\u0027t think the touch event needs to be on the GLThread or the like to improve performance, like is the case with PaintSurface possibly. If you interact with anything in the UI from this thread, which may be expected based on this being a Touch event, this may result in a random crash. Sentry reports segfault at android::IPCThreadState::joinThreadPool and subsequent thread aborts. By contrast, Touch event is raised on the main thread on Windows and iOS for both SKCanvasView and SKGLView, and also for SKCanvasView on Android, so SKGLView on Android is again an isolated exception.\n\n### Code\n\nNo code, just observed this with our game GnollHack.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nTouch events are raised on the main thread in all cases, also with SKGLView on Android.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nTouch event handler is called from a thread different from the main thread on Android for SKGLView.\n\n### Version of SkiaSharp\n\n3.116.0 (Current)\n\n### Last Known Good Version of SkiaSharp\n\nUnknown\n\n### IDE / Editor\n\nVisual Studio (Windows)\n\n### Platform / Operating System\n\nAndroid\n\n### Platform / Operating System Version\n\nAndroid 15\n\n### Devices\n\nGoogle Pixel 6a\n\n### Relevant Screenshots\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5401d32-cb79-4e9b-93c9-2704ffba9243)\n\n### Relevant Log Output\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060shell\nSee the screenshot from Sentry, which reports segfault at android::IPCThreadState::joinThreadPool\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project\u0027s Code of Conduct",
