  "title": "[FEATURE] Add a .NET Interactive kernel extension to display SkiaSharp types in notebooks",
  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to learn, experiment, use, document, and more with SkiaSharp in a .NET Interactive notebook. This means that in using SkiaSharp, various types could be displayed in the output cells of a notebook. I think this would be a huge feature and encourage more people to use SkiaSharp. It would open up a lot of use cases that don\u0027t necessarily require embedding SkiaSharp into a window or app or use cases that are better served in a notebook.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you\u0027d like**\r\n\r\nIt would be great to simply have .NET Interactive display images and animations created by SkiaSharp. For example:\r\n\r\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65685447/99871019-fc235a80-2b9c-11eb-9715-a5714afec344.png)\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you\u0027ve considered**\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nI had previously created an [issue in the .NET Interactive repository](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive/issues/902) with some more details. The way it was explained and that I understand it is that SkiaSharp would need to add a .NET Interactive kernel extension with implementations for each base type that would need to be displayed in an output cell.\r\n\r\n* [sample extensions](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive/tree/main/samples/extensions)\r\n* [extending .NET Interactive](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive/blob/main/docs/extending-dotnet-interactive.md)",
