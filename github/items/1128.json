  "title": "Please expose SkEncoder and derived classes",
  "body": "In Skia, we can use the [\u0060SkJpegEncoder\u0060](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/skia/include/encode/SkJpegEncoder.h) and other \u0060SkEncoder\u0060 derived classes to tweak the options of the image encoders.\r\n\r\nFor example, we need to disable chroma subsampling when exporting high quality JPEGs.\r\n\r\nHowever, these classes are not exposed in SkiaSharp.\r\n\r\nNow it seems they are not exposed in the official Skia C API either, so maybe convincing Google to make these part of the C API would be a first step?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nPeter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
