  "body": "**Description of Change**\r\n\r\nAdding a new iOS and Mac Catalyst sample.\r\n\r\nAlso, there is now support for building samples with .NET [Core]. You can opt into this by adding a solution (or solution filter) that has a \u0060-net\u0060 suffix:\r\n\r\n| Solution Name | .NET / MSBuild | Platform | \r\n| :- | :-: | :-: |\r\n| Sample.sln[f] | MSBuild | All |\r\n| Sample.Windows.sln[f] | MSBuild | Windows |\r\n| Sample.Mac.sln[f] | MSBuild | macOS |\r\n| Sample.Linux.sln[f] | MSBuild | Linux |\r\n| Sample.Windows-net.sln[f] | .NET | Windows |\r\n| Sample.Mac-net.sln[f] | .NET | macOS |\r\n| Sample.Linux-net.sln[f] | .NET | Linux |\r\n\r\n\u003E NOTE: \u0060Sample-net.sln[f]\u0060 is not supported yet as the logic is really rudimentary. It assumes the first component is the solution name and is located using a basic wildcard.\r\n",
