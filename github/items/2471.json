  "title": "[QUESTION] How to get SKTypeface.FromFamilyName to return a font for Japanese, Korean, Chinese (Android \u002B iOS, Xamarin.Forms)",
  "body": "I\u0027m using a library that uses SKTypeface.FromFamilyName internally to render font on the screen. However, as I found out if the text to display is japanese, korean or chinese, it just prints squares. I tried to add a custom font to my project but I was not able to make \u0060SKTypeface.FromFamilyName\u0060 return anything but _NULL_ with custom fonts. As I have no access to change \u0060SKTypeface.FromFamilyName\u0060 to something else ( at least as far as I know because it\u0027s in a private method of a static class - https://github.com/Mapsui/Mapsui/blob/5008d3ab8b0453c27cb487fe6ad3fac87435abbe/Mapsui.Rendering.Skia/LabelRenderer.cs#L277 ), is there any way I can make it return any font for each language (or one per language) that works with these?
