  "title": "[FEATURE] PDF respect 1bpp size (smaller output size)",
  "body": "### Is your feature request related to a problem?\n\nEverything works right now but only the file size of a pdf generated by SkiaSharp is too big, because 1bpp images are saved as 24bpp images.\n\n### Describe the solution you would like\n\nSituation:\r\nA pdf file (scanned document) contains images of 1bpp. The source PDF file itself is about 4MB in size.\r\n\r\nThis pdf file is being printed and the print job (XPS) is being modified (we keep using 1bpp here). After the modified XPS file we save it as a pdf file again with SkiaSharp. \r\nHowever the resulting pdf file now has a file size of 40\u002Bmb because all the 1bpp images are automatically converted to 24bpp by SkiaSharp.\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060 \r\ninput (PDF) --\u003E printed (XPS) --\u003E changes (XPS) --\u003E save with SkiaSharp (PDF)\r\n1 bpp       --\u003E 1 bpp         --\u003E 1 bpp         --\u003E 24 bpp\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060 \n\n### Describe alternatives you have considered\n\nNo other solution found with SkiaSharp\n\n### Additional context\n\nThe big file size is not acceptable. If we lower the quality of the jpg images the content is not sharp anymore and not acceptable.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project\u0027s Code of Conduct",
