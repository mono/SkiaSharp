  "title": "[FEATURE] Support webassembly using CanvasKit",
  "body": "I\u0027m using SkiaSharp now with great success in my Xamarin Forms application.\r\nI would like to dip into Blazor for the same project so I also need a Canvas-like control. While i probably could use javascript interops to the html canvas, it would be great to also have Skia here.\r\nI\u0027ve recently seen that Skia already supports webassembly, see link: [skia canvaskit](https://skia.org/user/modules/canvaskit\r\n)\r\nWould it be hard to use this to have a SkiaSharp.Web implementation?\r\n\r\nKind regards\n\n\u003E VS bug [#770225](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/770225)",
