  "title": "[QUESTION] Can we set the canvas size/resolution of an SKCanvasView",
  "body": "I\u0027ve been hunting around for an answer to this directly but can\u0027t find anything other than people setting SKBitmaps with a Width/Height and then making an SKCanvas from that.\r\n\r\nI\u0027m talking specifically with the SKCanvasView.\r\n\r\nFor example, I have an SKCanvasView that basically fills most of the screen, on this I\u0027m drawing a bunch of lines, text and circles (think schematic drawing) that can be scaled, rotated and moved with gestures (using SkiaScene plugin).\r\n\r\nThis runs super smooth on iphones (with a Canvas size of 750x1086, seems 60fps on a 6) but on my ipad mini 4 its a bit laggy (Canvas size of 2048x1276 and maybe as low as 15/20fps)\r\n\r\nI\u0027m *guessing* its the increased canvas size causing the issue, I\u0027d at least like to try to narrow that down by trying out a smaller canvas size but stretched to fill the screen. Is that possible?\r\n\r\nCan I set the SKCanvasView to fill screen, but say have an internal canvas of 1024x638 (same aspect ratio, but quarter the resolution)?\r\n\r\nI understand too that my paint widths and text sizes would appear bigger on screen, but I already have a dynamic text size/paint scaling for different canvas sizes to produce \u0027similar\u0027 results...\r\n",
