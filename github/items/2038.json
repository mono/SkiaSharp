  "title": "[QUESTION] Stop Blazor View canvas from auto resizing",
  "body": "It seems that the canvas in Blazor is automatically resized to match the original proportions. I don\u0027t know if I\u0027m missing something or if this is the default behavior. I would like to have the canvas to always fill the available width and height, in order to accommodate my application running in portrait and landscape orientations.\r\n\r\nMy CSS for the canvas is:\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n.canvas-container {\r\n    line-height: 1;\r\n}\r\n\r\n    .canvas-container canvas {\r\n        width: 100%;\r\n        height: 100%;\r\n        max-width: 100%;\r\n        max-height: 100%;\r\n    }\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\nIt works initially, but then when the window is resized, it keeps the original proportion and resizes itself accordingly.",
