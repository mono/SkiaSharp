The technically should not happen as the canvas is still valid - and we can see this when we set the canvas as a class field.\r\n\r\nBut, for now, just work around the issue by adding the canvas as a field.\r\n\r\nIn addition, do more granular construction of the GL objects, and then also reduce the amount of interop in the render loop.\r\n\r\n**Bugs Fixed**\r\n\r\n- Fixes #1121 \r\n- Fixes #910\r\n- Fixes #1173\r\n- Fixes #1168\r\n- Fixes #1144\r\n\r\n**API Changes**\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n**Behavioral Changes**\r\n\r\nSome fixes for crashes.\r\n\r\n**PR Checklist**\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has tests (if omitted, state reason in description)\r\n- [ ] Rebased on top of master at time of PR\r\n- [ ] Changes adhere to coding standard\r\n- [ ] Updated documentation\r\n",
