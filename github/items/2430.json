In XF, I was using a different component for Lottie animations now I\u0027m in need to use SKLottieView. My question is: is there a way to display an animation that is stored in memory inside as a JSON string variable? We download JSON animations as strings from our database, because we have many, we can\u0027t use too much space for files, and we add new animations on the server side avoiding the need of republishing the app just for new animations. \r\nThanks in advance.\r\n",
