  "body": "**Description of Change**\r\n\r\nMove all the non-.NET Core runtimes out of the runtimes folder. \r\n\r\nThis is causing issues with platforms that also use it, but are unsupported by .NET Core - eg: Tizen. Tizen uses \u0060tizen-armel\u0060 and \u0060linux-x86\u0060 which is not good for \u0060dotnet publish\u0060. Also, \u0060runtimes\u0060 is getting cluttered.\r\n\r\nThis PR moves all the platforms into the build folder, next to the .targets that will be including it.\r\n\r\n**Bugs Fixed**\r\n\r\n- Fixes #1301\r\n- Related to #1296 \r\n",
