For each type, find XML file in \u0060docs/SkiaSharpAPI/\u003CNamespace\u003E/\u003CType\u003E.xml\u0060\n2. Find corresponding C# source file in \u0060binding/**\u0060 or \u0060source/**\u0060\n3.

Commit each type separately\n\n**Current Status:**\n- \u2705 HarfBuzzSharp.Blob migrated successfully (all members documented)\n- \u26A0\uFE0F HarfBuzzSharp.BlobReleaseDelegate - missing in code (obsolete delegate)\n- \uD83D\uDD04 HarfBuzzSharp.Buffer partially migrated:\n  - \u2705 Type summary and constructor documented  \n  - \u2705 Key properties (ContentType, Direction, Language) documented\n  - \u2705 DefaultReplacementCodepoint field documented\n  - \u26A0\uFE0F Many members have placeholder documentation (\u0022To be added.\u0022)\n  - \uD83D\uDD04 Large class with 60\u002B members - will focus on simpler types next\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Focus on enum types and smaller classes with better documentation\n- Return to complete Buffer class members later if needed\n\n\u003C!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX --\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003C!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS --\u003E\n---\n\n\uD83D\uDCAC Share your feedback on Copilot coding agent for the chance to win a $200 gift card!
