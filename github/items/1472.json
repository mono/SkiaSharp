  "title": "[QUESTION] VirusTotal says that libSkiaSharp.framework has: Trojan:Script/Wacatac.C!ml",
  "body": "I\u0027ve just noticed that Microsoft scanner in VirusTotal reports that libSkiaSharp.framework which is included in SkiaSharp (2.80.1) package contains \u0060Trojan:Script/Wacatac.C!ml\u0060. I know it\u0027s strange but Facebook recently blocked one of my dev accounts because my app contains malware. \r\n\r\nThe funny thing that other Antiviruses didn\u0027t detect anything and I think it\u0027s false-positive report but Facebook mentioned that they will unblock it once VirusTotal doesn\u0027t detect anything.\r\n\r\nThe current report is:\r\nhttps://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/9ff0ecec52a936c6b1135c508d6794c4913f73d0988e544f6119e3f5e5d039b0/detection\r\n\r\nIt could be reproduced by adding SkiaSharp into a project and create IPA. Then you can submit IPA into https://www.virustotal.com/gui/\r\n\r\nOnce SkiaSharp is removed from the project then Microsoft scanner doesn\u0027t detect anything. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
