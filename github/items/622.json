  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nWe are developing a WPF Desktop product, using the SKElement to render to screen. When drawing a SKPath with a large number of lines (1000 in our test), framerate drops significantly as CPU usage on our UI thread maxes out. Our use case could have need to display hundreds or even thousands of graphical elements.\r\n\r\n- Is the SKElement control GPU-accelerated?\r\n\r\n- If not, would it be worth our bother creating our own that creates a GL GRContext? To do this will require compiling our own ANGLE dll, as the nuget packages only target Windows Store, which isn\u0027t compatible with a WPF Desktop project.\r\n\r\n### Basic Information\r\n\r\n- Version with issue:  1.60.3\r\n- IDE:  Visual Studio 2017\r\n- Platform Target Frameworks: \r\n  - Windows Classic:  WPF Desktop 4.7.1 on Windows 10\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Link\r\nWe created a demo solution demonstrating our issue:\r\n[https://github.com/ibgorton/skia_wpf_slow](url)\r\n",
