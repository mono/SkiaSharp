  "body": "When uploading an image from mobile, it is always rotated to landscape view. But when you access the image in code you usually want to save it in correct orientation.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, there is no easy way to rotate the image. So it would be nice to have something like \u0060AutoOrient()\u0060 which would correctly rotate the image based on its EXIF data.\r\n",
