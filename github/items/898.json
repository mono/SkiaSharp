  "title": "Update Xamarin.Forms to v4.0",
  "body": "Xamarin.Forms v4.0 has been out in previews for several months already, and it went stable just over a month ago. It brings many new features and improvements and we would like to help the community move forward as well as prepare for the day when we need those new features.\r\n\r\nAs a result, we are looking to update the version of Xamarin.Forms we depend on to version 4.0. This is a major version, but it has been shipping in the guise of 3.5 and 3.6 under feature flags and other checks.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any objections to updating the v1.68.1 release of SkiaSharp to use Xamarin.Forms v4.0?",
