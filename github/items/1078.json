  "body": "**Description of Change**\r\n\r\nIn addition to having no compile-time dependency (and as pointed out in https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/issues/1029#issuecomment-568156345), the nuspec file for View.WPF does not reference any OpenTK packages, so Views.WPF shouldn\u0027t need to reference these packages either.\r\n\r\n**Bugs Fixed**\r\n\r\nRelated to issue #1029.  This change removes two warnings when targeting .NET Core in View.WPF.\r\n\r\n**API Changes**\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n**Behavioral Changes**\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n**PR Checklist**\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has tests (if omitted, state reason in description)\r\n- [ ] Rebased on top of master at time of PR\r\n - NA\r\n- [x] Changes adhere to coding standard\r\n- [ ] Updated documentation\r\n",
