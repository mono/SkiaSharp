  "title": "[FEATURE] Xamarin.Forms Android: Add an option to SKGLView to paint on the UI thread",
  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nI am currently working on a UI framework in SkiaSharp. SKGLView on iOS and UWP paints the surface on the main thread, and Android does not. Because of this, I have concurrency issues when updating my state on the main thread on Android.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you\u0027d like**\r\n\r\nAn option on SKGLView to ensure that painting gets called on the UI thread.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you\u0027ve considered**\r\n\r\nCalling \u0060InvokeOnMainThreadAsync\u0060 and waiting for it, but that deadlocks when rotating the screen.",
