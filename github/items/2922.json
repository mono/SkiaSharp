  "body": "**Description of Change**\r\n\r\nWhen a view is resized, the canvas is not yet resized and updated to match. Before this PR, the canvas would be stretched to fill the view. This PR make sure to not stretch the canvas but instead keep it fixed.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the scaling in the first place is that \u0060WriteableBitmap\u0060 does not have a DPI parameter. As a result, we have to create a larger bitmap than the view such that when it is scaled down to match the view size, the resolution matches that of the rest of the app. Previously, the larger canvas was just squashed to fit, but this was non-uniform. This PR always scales the canvas to the correct size preserving the aspect ratio.\r\n\r\n**Bugs Fixed**\r\n\r\n- None.\r\n\r\n\u003C!-- Provide links to issues here.
