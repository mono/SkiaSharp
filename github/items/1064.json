  "body": "**Description**\r\n\r\nI use SKGLView in a Xamarin Forms app. When I leave the app to another app and come back, the GRContext is null and so I could not draw the screen again. This happens on Android 5.0. On Android 9.0 I don\u0027t have this problem. Both tested with the emulator.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I should call something to recreate the GRContext after coming back?\r\n\r\n**Code**\r\n\r\n\u003C!-- a snippet of code that demonstrates the issue --\u003E\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\n\u003C!-- a general description of what was the expected behavior or result --\u003E\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\n\u003C!-- a general description of what really happened --\u003E\r\n\r\n**Basic Information**\r\n\r\n- Version with issue:  1.68.1\r\n- Last known good version:  \u003C!-- the version of SkiaSharp that still working --\u003E\r\n- IDE:  Visual Studio 2019\r\n- Platform Target Frameworks:\r\n  - Android: Android 5.0 (API21) \r\n- Target Devices:   \u003C!-- the devices that you noticed this on, e.g. iPhone X --\u003E\r\n  - Emulator with Android 5.0 (Nexus 4)\r\n  - Emulator with Android 9.0 (Pixel 2)\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n\u003C!-- if the issue is a visual issue, please include screenshots showing the problem if possible --\u003E\r\n\r\n**Reproduction Link**\r\n\r\n\u003C!-- please upload or provide a link to a reproduction case --\u003E\r\n",
