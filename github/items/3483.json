  "body": "**Description of Change**\r\n\r\nCreated a skill-based architecture for adding C# APIs to SkiaSharp, eliminating duplication and establishing clear separation between execution workflows, quick reference, and comprehensive documentation.\r\n\r\n**Changes:**\r\n\r\n- **Created \u0060.github/skills/add-api/SKILL.md\u0060** \u2014 6-phase structured workflow (analyze C\u002B\u002B \u2192 add C API \u2192 commit submodule \u2192 generate bindings \u2192 wrap in C# \u2192 test) with checkpoints preventing common mistakes (lost submodule commits, manual edits of generated files, skipped tests)\r\n\r\n- **Optimized \u0060.github/copilot-instructions.md\u0060** \u2014 Reduced from 496 to 416 lines by replacing detailed workflows with summaries and links. Added \u0060add-api\u0060 to skills table. Created \u0022Working with Native Skia Submodule\u0022 and \u0022Adding New APIs\u0022 sections as concise references pointing to the skill and comprehensive docs.\r\n\r\n- **Enhanced \u0060documentation/adding-apis.md\u0060** \u2014 Added submodule git workflow section with step-by-step commands, expanded checklist from 3 to 5 phases, added common mistakes table.\r\n\r\n**Architecture:** Three-tier system where skill provides structured execution, instructions provide quick reference, and documentation provides comprehensive guide. Follows pattern established by native-dependency-update and other skills.\r\n\r\n**Bugs Fixed**\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n**API Changes**\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n**Behavioral Changes**\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n**Required skia PR**\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n**PR Checklist**\r\n\r\n- [x] Has tests (if omitted, state reason in description) \u2014 Documentation only\r\n- [ ] Rebased on top of main at time of PR\r\n- [ ] Merged related skia PRs\r\n- [x] Changes adhere to coding standard\r\n- [x] Updated documentation\r\n",
