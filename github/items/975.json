  "body": "With .Net Core 3 coming up soon, has there been discussion on implementing .Net Core with SkiaSharp.Views? \r\n\r\nRight now I am using version 1.68.0 for my Net Core cross platform project. It gives me the warning \u0022Package was restored using .NETFramework...\u0022. It still works, but seeing that .Net Core is supposed to replace any new and upcoming projects from being created in NetFramework, it would be important to have a functioning version of SkiaSharp.Views available.\r\n",
