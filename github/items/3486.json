  "body": "This pull request updates the NuGet package feed URL used for downloading and comparing packages from the preview feed to the CI artifacts feed. The change ensures that the build and utility scripts now reference the CI feed instead of the previous preview feed.\r\n\r\nFeed URL update:\r\n\r\n* Updated the variable from \u0060PREVIEW_FEED_URL\u0060 to \u0060CI_ARTIFACTS_FEED_URL\u0060 in \u0060build.cake\u0060 and changed its default value to point to the SkiaSharp CI artifacts NuGet feed.\r\n* Updated all references in \u0060scripts/cake/UtilsManaged.cake\u0060 to use \u0060CI_ARTIFACTS_FEED_URL\u0060 instead of \u0060PREVIEW_FEED_URL\u0060 for package source and comparison operations.",
