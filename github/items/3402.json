  "title": "[FEATURE] Drawing to and from compressed indexed color bitmaps",
  "body": "### Is your feature request related to a problem?\n\nI am using avalonia ui which uses this and I wanted to make a nes/snes graphics system in avalonia ui.\n\nProblem is I have tried doing this multiple times and I just don\u0027t have the experience to do it. \n\nThe reason I want to do this is so I can store graphics into a binary file and minimize size.\nI want to have a 8 * 8 * 32 * 30 * 65536 pixels which in 4bpp color would be 1.87 GiB if the entire binary is filled. According to google this would take 15 GiB with 32bpp color if the entire binary is filled.\n\n### Describe the solution you would like\n\nPlease support drawing to and from compressed 1bpp 2bpp and 4bpp indexed color graphics\n\n### Describe alternatives you have considered\n\n- Writing my own blitter.\n- Looking for image libraries that do this\n\n### Additional context\n\nPixel operations should work on multiple pixels at a time with these formats without expanding them in memory.\n\nThe only time these compressed formats should be uncompressed is to convert them into a higher bpp format.\n\nOf course it should not allocate more then the target pixel format.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project\u0027s Code of Conduct",
