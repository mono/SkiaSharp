  "title": "Support for GPU Acceleration for WinUI3",
  "body": "GPU Acceleration is important in SkiaSharp for scenarios where you have large fill areas on high dpi monitors, as well as just general performance maximization. It\u0027s important that GPU acceleration is also supported for the WinUI3 platform.\r\n\r\nIt seems the challenge was lack of support for Angle. Is this still valid? Are there alternatives?\r\n",
