  "body": "It seems that the documentation in https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/wiki/SkiaSharp-Native-Assets-for-Linux is incomplete, because I have noticed that in my build, after adding the nuget package SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.Linux and building the project, the .so file doesn\u0027t actually get copied to the proper location.\r\n\r\nHow do you guys do it? A PostBuild msbuild task to copy the file? Thanks\r\n",
