  "body": "First lets say thank you very much for your work. It is great and I enjoy it.\r\n\r\nI\u0027m missing for the SkiaSharp implementation for Xamarin.Forms a SKTouchAction.WheelUp and SKTouchAction.WheelDown for the mouse. The click with the wheel is correct handled as MouseButton.Middle. It would be perfect to have this for platforms, that use a mouse (UWP and Mac).\n\n\u003E VS bug [#727960](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/727960)",
