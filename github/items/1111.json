  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI have been reading the documentation on SkiaSharp and I have seen a lot of information on how to read an SVG file and render it to the canvas but I haven\u0027t been able to find concrete information about saving/exporting a rendered image (or canvas) to an SVG file. Is this functionality supported or is there any plans to be supported in the future?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for the help in advance,",
