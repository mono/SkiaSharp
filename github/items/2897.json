  "title": "[FEATURE] Encode animated GIFs",
  "body": "### Is your feature request related to a problem?\r\n\r\nI want to encode animated GIFs but SkiaSharp seems to be missing this feature.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you would like\r\n\r\nGiven a series of 1-dimensional byte arrays of pixels in RGBA8888 (four bytes per pixel, one array per frame) a value for how long to delay on each frame and a width, encode an animated GIF.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you have considered\r\n\r\nSixLabors.ImageSharp will do this and that\u0027s what I\u0027ve been using so far but I\u0027d like to switch to SkiaSharp because ImageSharp is my only dependency which isn\u0027t MIT-licensed. This is the only thing I\u0027m using ImageSharp for which SkiaSharp (AFAIK) can\u0027t do.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project\u0027s Code of Conduct",
