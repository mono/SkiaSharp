  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nI am looking to subdivide conic curves for my vector editor, and it looks like Skia already has a method for this. It would be great to expose this if possible:\r\nhttps://github.com/google/skia/blob/main/src/core/SkGeometry.cpp#L1438\r\n\r\n\u003C!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I need to do X, but the API is missing from the C# binding. --\u003E\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you\u0027ve considered**\r\n\r\nFiguring out the algorithms myself, but reading and understanding math research is outside the realm of my expertise \uD83D\uDE1B \r\n",
