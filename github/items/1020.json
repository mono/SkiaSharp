  "body": "**Description of Change**\r\n\r\n\u0060dotnet build\u0060 is not quite the same as \u0060msbuild\u0060 and \u0060[System.Environment]::Is64BitOperatingSystem\u0060 cannot be used. We should use \u0060[System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation]::OSArchitecture\u0060 instead. Unfortunately, that type was added only in later MSBuilds based on net471\u002B. \r\n\r\nHowever, \u0060$(MSBuildRuntimeType)\u0060 was added in MSBuild 15 which is old enough.\r\n\r\n**Bugs Fixed**\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\nerror MSB4185: The function \u0022Is64BitOperatingSystem\u0022 on type \u0022System.Environment\u0022 is not available for execution as an MSBuild property function.\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\n**API Changes**\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n**Behavioral Changes**\r\n\r\nNone. Except that it should now build net45\u002B with dotnet build.\r\n\r\n**PR Checklist**\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has tests (if omitted, state reason in description)\r\n- [ ] Rebased on top of master at time of PR\r\n- [ ] Changes adhere to coding standard\r\n- [ ] Updated documentation\r\n",
