  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nSkia SkRect provides methods to inset a rectangle\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\nvoid inset(SkScalar dx, SkScalar dy)\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\nI noticed that SKRoundRect provides a method called Deflate that binds to sk_rrect_inset. The functionality is provided by SKRoundRect but not by SKRect\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you\u0027d like**\r\nProvide a C# binding to the inset method of SKRect. \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you\u0027ve considered**\r\nIn order to inset a rectangle you have to manually create a new rectangle.\r\n",
