E.g.  \u0060Bgra8888\u0060 is actually an \u0060UNORM\u0060 8-bit unsigned integer. \r\n\r\nOne exception though, the \u0060SkColorType.RgbaF16\u0060 in v1.68 is actually **not** normalized at all... The new \u0060RgbaF16Normalized\u0060 is, but \u0060normalized\u0060 here means something different, since the floating point numbers are not [normalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_(image_processing)), but rather just **clamped** between \u0060[0..1]\u0060...  So maybe \u0060SkColorType.RgbaF16Clamped\u0060 would be a better way to describe this? I\u0027m not 100% sure this is correct, maybe \u0060kRGBA_F16Norm_SkColorType\u0060 does something different...\r\n\r\nSince the new members are not yet in \u0060master\u0060, maybe the C# API could use a more consistent naming? I would just drop the \u0060unnormalized\u0060 in the name, but I\u0027m not sure what to do with the floating point related members...\r\n\r\nTricky.\r\n",
