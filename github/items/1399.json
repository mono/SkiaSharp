  "body": "**Description of Change**\r\n\r\nHistorically, SkTypeface.charsToGlyphs assumed the data was already in glyphs. So a UTF32 data array would pass the number of glyphs. Since that method was removed, we switched to SkFont.textToGlyphs. This worked in bytes. As a result, we need to make sure we convert from glyph count to byte count when we use it.\r\n\r\n**Bugs Fixed**\r\n\r\n- Fixes #1398\r\n\r\n**API Changes**\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n**Behavioral Changes**\r\n\r\n\u0060SKTypeface.GetGlyphs\u0060 now correctly passes the byte size to the font.\r\n\r\n**PR Checklist**\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has tests (if omitted, state reason in description)\r\n- [ ] Rebased on top of master at time of PR\r\n- [ ] Changes adhere to coding standard\r\n- [ ] Updated documentation\r\n",
