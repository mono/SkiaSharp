  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nPerformance improvement. Drawing a line of a document would allocate (because a sub array/string is needed).\r\n\r\nThis can be avoided by passing \u0060Span\u003Cbyte/char\u003E\u0060 or \u0060Memory\u003Cbyte/char\u003E\u0060.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you\u0027d like**\r\nadd overloads for Span and Memory where appropriate.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you\u0027ve considered**\r\nusing the TextBlobBuilder seems to be a lot more complicated. If there is a better way to do what I want please let me know. \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI\u0027m trying to build a simple text editor control that utilises Skia as a rendering backend.\r\n",
