  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nThe download and install of SkiaSharp is potentially an issue with about 100MB of native files to pull down.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you\u0027d like**\r\nThe installation of SkiaSharp should only pull down the native assets that are actually required. If I install a package into Xamarin.iOS, don\u0027t pull down macOS, UWP, Android, and all the rest. 8MB is better than 100MB\r\n",
