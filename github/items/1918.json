  "title": "[QUESTION] Exceptions generated by SKGLControl when used within MDI children forms (when the forms are re-parented)",
  "body": "Hello,\r\nI\u0027m using two SKGLControls in MDI child windows of my application.  When created, the controls are children of the main window and are maximized and appear under tabs in the center are of the main window.  Both SKGLControls work initially.  However, when I drag one out so that it\u0027s in its own window, the SKGLControl turns black and rendering appears to stop, even though the paint event is firing, my drawing code is running, and the canvas.Flush() call is happening.\r\n\r\nWhen I drag the other SKGLControl out, the application crashes with a System.AccessViolationException inside the canvas.Flush() method.  This behavior is consistent across many runs ... the first one turns black when dragged out, even if the other MDI child window isn\u0027t created, and the other one generates the exception, again, even if the first one isn\u0027t created.  The drawing code is different for these two, and I\u0027m assuming that there are memory violations in both cases, but the first one doesn\u0027t happen to cause a crash as quickly.\r\n\r\nWhat might be going on here?  I would have thought SKGLControl would handle reparenting (and it may).  I\u0027ve also tried getting the GRContext and calling AbandonContext(true) when the parent changes.  This fails on the next OnPaint() with an \u0022Object reference not set to an instance of an object.\u0022 exception.\r\n\r\nI\u0027m on windows 10 build 19043.1348, using the SkiaSharp, SkiaSharp.Views.Desktop.Common and SkiaSharp.Views.WindowsForms nuget packages, all v2.80.3.",
