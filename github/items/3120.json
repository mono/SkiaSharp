  "title": "[FEATURE] Add support for radial gradient on \u0060SKSvgCanvas\u0060",
  "body": "### Is your feature request related to a problem?\r\n\r\nUntil now only linear gradient was supported on \u0060SKSvgCanvas\u0060, radial gradient was not implemented in Skia https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/issues/3095.\r\n\r\nThis is no longer the case, as support has been added for both radial and two-point conical gradients: https://github.com/google/skia/commit/f784f78a5669962a23243ff67997239a64ce8c99\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you would like\r\n\r\nThe gradients should work on \u0060SKSvgCanvas\u0060, just like they do on \u0060SKCanvas\u0060.\r\nCurrent Skia bindings might work, but additional implementation may be needed.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you have considered\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project\u0027s Code of Conduct",
