  "title": "Provide allocation-free overloads of methods in SKTextBlobBuilder",
  "body": "In Uno Platform, we are using \u0060AllocatePositionedRun\u0060, which in some scenarios can be problematic as it\u0027s allocating and it\u0027s in a hot path. See for example this is a case where this was responsible for 11.3% of all allocations.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/assets/31348972/b3761455-752d-4d65-9a04-48d78b5cd2b5)\r\n\r\nThe idea here is to introduce a new API that won\u0027t allocate \u0060SKPositionedRunBuffer\u0060 and instead give us the \u0060Span\u0060s that we need right away. I have made the same change to APIs other than \u0060AllocatePositionedRun\u0060 for parity.",
