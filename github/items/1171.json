  "title": "[QUESTION] Trying to get Accord.NET to work with SkiaSharp",
  "body": "I want to use Accord.net in unity on android app.\r\nSince Accord.Net is the only netCore opencv competitor this should be almost trivial task since it works almost on any cpu. But there is one caveat - it relies on dreaded System.Drawing for things  like image operations and color structs and image filtering.\r\nThat locks the visual side of the Accord on windows only.\r\nI want to replace the System.Drawing namespace with skiasharp one with something like a glue code that translates the system.drawing types to the skias references.\r\nFor example Bitmap class should inherit from SKBitmap and Color from SKColor (or implement similar methods)\r\nIs this viable ? I dont want to recompile whole Accord lib just to get some functions but this will prolly be this way.",
