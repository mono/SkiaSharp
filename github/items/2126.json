  "title": "[skottie] Handle non-seekable streams",
  "body": "**Description of Change**\r\n\r\nOn Android, the streams for the Assets are not seekable - and the same with streams from the internet. So in order to actually read those, we first need to read the whole thing into a memory buffer.\r\n\r\nThis is not as expensive as it may sound as this is what happens internally. In C\u002B\u002B, the full stream is read into a SKData instance, so pre-doing it in C# is the same thing. In fact, doing it via a data instance in C# opens up the potential to reduce the number of times we hop the interop boundary.\r\n\r\n**Bugs Fixed**\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n**API Changes**\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060cs\r\nclass Animation {\r\n  public static Animation? Create (SKData data);\r\n  public static bool TryCreate (SKData data, out Animation? animation);\r\n}\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\n**Behavioral Changes**\r\nNon-seekable streams can now be used to create animations.\r\n\r\n**Required skia PR**\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n\u003C!-- Replace this with the full URL to the skia PR. --\u003E\r\n\r\n**PR Checklist**\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has tests (if omitted, state reason in description)\r\n- [ ] Rebased on top of main at time of PR\r\n- [ ] Merged related skia PRs\r\n- [ ] Changes adhere to coding standard\r\n- [ ] Updated documentation\r\n",
