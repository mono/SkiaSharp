The reason for this was there was no OpenGL on ARM. However, recently, there is a way: https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nqpsl29bfff\r\n\r\nThe reason we can just remove this code is because we don\u0027t actually link with opengl32 directly and instead load it at runtime. \r\n\r\n**Bugs Fixed**\r\n\r\n- Fixes #3155\r\n\r\n\u003C!-- Provide links to issues here.
