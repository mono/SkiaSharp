  "body": "Hello everyone. I have an issue with SKCanvasView drawings beeing incorrectly drawn AFTER cell reuse. \r\n\r\nBasically I am using a custom cell in a xib file and with a view, in this view I am drawing a segmented progress bar. \r\n\r\nThe first time the table cells are rendered correctly, but after scrolling down and up again, the contents on the not visible cells get messed up after reappearing. Not reusing cells is not an option as I have many items in the list. The OnPaint event is set up in the view cell class, not on the viewmodel. \r\n\r\nBasically I am searching for a way to not have to redraw on the cell item canvas each time the cell is reused. This means I want the cells to keep its data, even after reused by the UITableView. ",
