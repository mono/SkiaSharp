  "body": "SkiaSharp can output images and output to svg.\r\nHowever, what I want to do is to save the picture drawn with SkiaSharp as a proprietary file.\r\nTo achieve this, I want to save the object state as XML with C # XmlSerializer.\r\nHowever, I noticed a problem that XmlSerializer does not support some SkiaSharp classes and structures (Ex. SKColor, SKBitmap, SKPath...).\r\nI would be happy if you responded quickly.\r\nThank you.",
