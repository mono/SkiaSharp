  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nRight now, installing the SkiaSharp.Views.WindowsForms or SkiaSharp.Views.WPF packages will give a warning saying that it is not targeting the right thing and all that.\r\n\r\n- [x] SkiaSharp.Views.Desktop.Common\r\n- [x] SkiaSharp.Views.WPF\r\n- [x] SkiaSharp.Views.WindowsForms\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you\u0027d like**\r\nWe would like a nice package that targets both net45 and netcoreapp\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you\u0027ve considered**\r\nWe can use the NoWarn feature, but that is extra work that is unnecessary.\r\n",
