  "body": "**Description of Change**\r\n\r\nUse the latest version of ANGLE. This will require building with vcpkg.\r\n\r\nThe update requires a few changes to the parameters passed to ANGLE. This is because Microsoft used certain values, but they had to be tweaked to fit in with the overall ANGLE project. Functionality is the same, just different names and values.\r\n\r\n**Bugs Fixed**\r\n\r\n- Gets us the first half of #243 (this PR is just UWP, but it will be easy to add Win32)\r\n- This is required for #1071 (the NuGet we were using does not have arm64)\r\n\r\n**API Changes**\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n**Behavioral Changes**\r\n\r\nProbably none, but we are updating ANGLE.\r\n\r\n**PR Checklist**\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has tests (if omitted, state reason in description)\r\n- [ ] Rebased on top of master at time of PR\r\n- [ ] Changes adhere to coding standard\r\n- [ ] Updated documentation\r\n",
