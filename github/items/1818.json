  "body": "We have requirement to measure a string with required font by using SkiaSharp. \r\n\r\nHere, when we try to measure the Kerning applied text \u0022Test document for DOCX to PDF conversion\u0022 with \u0022Calibri Light\u0022 font.\r\n\r\nAttached the measuring code example ([UsingGDI.zip](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/files/7246052/UsingGDI.zip)) of using the System.Drawing.Graphics.MeasureString(), it return the exact width of the text as \u0022482.918\u0022 point as expected.\r\n\r\nBut, we are willing to use SkiaSharp library since it supported in multiple platforms. When we measure the same text using SkiaSharp ([UsingSkiaSharp.zip](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/files/7249354/UsingSkiaSharp.zip)) return the \u0022488.5918\u0022 point. \r\n \r\nCould you please suggest us a solution to get the same width as in Graphics.MeasureString() via SkiaSharp.",
