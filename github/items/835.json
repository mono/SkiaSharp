  "body": "I\u0027m running locally on Windows and I find that if I run my application multithreaded, I get a lot of the debugger output:\r\n\r\nNot replacing existing, living, managed instance with new object.\r\n\r\nI don\u0027t seem to get this if I only run with a single thread. I haven\u0027t tracked down the reproduction any more than that yet.\r\n\r\nThe source code seems to point to this line:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/blob/master/binding/Binding/SKObject.cs#L124\r\n\r\nBut I don\u0027t yet understand when \u0060RegisterHandle\u0060 gets called.\r\n\r\nIs this a harmless message? Is there something I should change to prevent this from occurring?",
