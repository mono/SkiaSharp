  "title": "[BUG] SkiaSharp views do not emit mouse motion events when a mouse button is not clicked",
  "body": "On platforms with a mouse, the only way to track mouse motion is through the Touch events and it only happens when a mouse key is pressed. In many uses cases you still need the mouse motion without any of the mouse keys pressed, for example to prelight objects. For now I have reproduce this error in the Forms views.\r\n\r\nFrom the SKTouchEventArgs API I understand this could be achieved emitting the motion event with the InContact property to false, am I correct? Otherwise this would be a feature instead of bug :)",
