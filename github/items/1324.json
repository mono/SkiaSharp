  "body": "Calling  an SKPaint.MeasureText(mystring) or SKPaint.MeasureText( mystring, ref myrect)\r\nworks fine in a  UWP project, but switching to an Android build, an exception is raised saying that these functions can\u0027t be found.\r\n\r\nThere are some suggestions on Google that this general exception can be caused by cached versions of the packages being present. But I\u0027ve tried clearing the caches, removing and restoring all the packages etc. It consistently comes back.",
