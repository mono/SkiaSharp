  "body": "### Description\n\nIn release configuration on Windows using .NET MAUI 9.0 Preview 6, SkiaSharp 3.0 Preview 3.1, and NVDIA GPU, SKGLView is white or flashes in white for c. 200 ms when made visible. With integrated GPU (Intel UHD Graphics), SKGLView does not flash white but works properly. Both debug configuration with NVIDIA and integrated GPU in release mode work fine.\n\n### Code\n\nhttps://github.com/hyvanmielenpelit/GnollHack\r\n\r\nHowever, we already made a workaround by adding a black frame on the top of the flashing SKGLView for the first 250ms.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nSKGLView does not flash in white under any circumstances.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nSKGLView flashes in white for the first 200ms after being made visible when using .NET MAUI 9.0 Preview 6, SkiaSharp 3.0 Preview 3.1, release configuration, Windows platform, and NVDIA GPU.\n\n### Version of SkiaSharp\n\n3.x (Alpha)\n\n### Last Known Good Version of SkiaSharp\n\nOther (Please indicate in the description)\n\n### IDE / Editor\n\nVisual Studio (Windows)\n\n### Platform / Operating System\n\nWindows\n\n### Platform / Operating System Version\n\nWindows 11\n\n### Devices\n\nMSI Laptop with Intel UHD Graphics integrated GPU and NVIDIA GPU\n\n### Relevant Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant Log Output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project\u0027s Code of Conduct",
