  "body": "**Description of Change**\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the arm64 architecture for iOS simulators. \r\n\r\nBecause there is now both a device and a simulator arm64, we have to split the framework into separate files. It is possible to use xcframeworks, however there was some issues with it working with iOS Hot Restart (iPhone plugged into Windows directly) and also the current build does not do that. The simplest is to just have 2 frameworks and switch them out depending on the runtime identifier.\r\n\r\n**Bugs Fixed**\r\n\r\n- Fixes #2307\r\n\r\n\u003C!-- Provide links to issues here.
