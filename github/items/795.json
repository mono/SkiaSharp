  "body": "1. Adds a new \u0060omnisharp.json\u0060 file to the repo to allow users operating in VS Code to easily follow the style guidelines laid out in the documentation on the repo.\r\n    * If there\u0027s anything here that needs modifying, please let me know, but I have made every effort to tailor the configuration to the assigned style guide.\r\n2. I was just recently working in SKRegion.cs in #788 so I tidied up while I was there, and moved the style changes to this PR as it\u0027s more appropriate to do style changes separately to functionality.\r\n\r\nHopefully with the new style configuration file, contributors who prefer to use VS Code will find it much easier to follow the assigned style guide -- at least for myself, it\u0027s a very unfamiliar style when working with C#, but I suppose I\u0027m liable to be more unusual in that respect as I\u0027ve mostly worked in the PowerShell Core repo.",
