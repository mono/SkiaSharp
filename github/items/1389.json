  "body": "**Description of Change**\r\n\r\nInstead of having to manually download and update libSkiaSharp.a for WASM, just depend on the \u0060SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.WebAssembly\u0060 package. This doesn\u0027t do anything except expose a path to the actual \u0060libSkiaSharp.a\u0060 which you can then use in whatever tooling you need.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 ways to do this:\r\n - property value \u0060$(SkiaSharpStaticLibraryPath)\u0060\r\n - item group \u0060@(SkiaSharpStaticLibrary)\u0060\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother way to use this package is as a build-time dependency. Since you have the path to the package, you can add it as an embedded resource or copy it to the output as content. To prevent a dependency with \u0060dotnet pack\u0060, just mark the \u0060\u003CPackageReference\u003E\u0060 with a \u0060PrivateAssets=\u0022all\u0022\u0060 property. Then only you will see it in that project.\r\n",
