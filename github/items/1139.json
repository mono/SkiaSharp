  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nJPEG images and other image file types can have additional metadata properties that can enhance how the picture is interpreted by renderers.  An example is the \r\n\u0060\u0022/xmp/{wstr=http://ns.google.com/photos/1.0/panorama/}:ProjectionType\u0022 = \u0022equirectangular\u0022\u0060 property which identifies an image as a 360 panoramic projection image.\r\nYou can easily use the exiftool app https://exiftool.org/gui/ to add the metadata but I need to add it in the code of my app.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you\u0027d like**\r\nAdd a dictionary property to SKJpegEncoderOptions to enable setting metadata properties when encoding JPEG images.\r\n**Describe alternatives you\u0027ve considered**\r\nNone known.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n",
