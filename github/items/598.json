  "body": "Current temprary hacks for tizen-x86 RID are still needed because the Tizen 4.0 platform\r\nincluding .NETCore 2.0 does not understand the tizen-x86 RID.\r\n\r\nIn this changes, Use TizenTPKFiles defined in Tizen.NET.Sdk instead of Link and CopyToOutputDirectory\r\nto solve following problems.\r\n- The linked file (runtime/linux-x86/native/foo.so) is displayed in VS Project tree.\r\n- The linked file is always copied to tpkroot/bin even when RID is specified.\r\n- The linked file can\u0027t be excluded with the file excluding features of Tizen.NET.Sdk.\r\n\r\nThe files added to TizenTPKFiles will be copied to tpkroot by Tizen.NET.Sdk, see\r\nhttps://github.com/Samsung/build-task-tizen/blob/master/src/Tizen.NET.Build.Tasks/build/Tizen.NET.Sdk.Packaging.targets",
