  "title": "[FEATURE] Native library name versioning",
  "body": "Consider the following scenario:\r\n\r\n- an app with plugin architecture like Visual Studio\r\n- extension #1 (strong named) uses SkiaSharp 1.60.0\r\n- extension #2 (strong named) uses SkiaSharp 1.68.0\r\n- both extensions get successfully loaded and have different versions of SkiaSharp in the same process\r\n- both versions of SkiaSharp are P/Invoking with the same library name, but only one native dll will be loaded\r\n- one of the versions of SkiaSharp will blow up spectacularly because of C API incompatibility, potentially with access violation\r\n\r\nSolution: use library name suffix, e. g.:\r\n\u0060libSkiaSharp.1.68.0.dll\u0060\r\n\u0060libSkiaSharp.1.68.0.dylib\u0060\r\n\u0060libSkiaSharp.1.68.0.so\u0060",
