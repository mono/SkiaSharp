  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nNot really, It\u0027s related to a potential missing features.\r\n\r\n\u003C!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I need to do X, but the API is missing from the C# binding. --\u003E\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you\u0027d like**\r\nNowadays I need to open Adobe Reader for digitally sign PDF Documents. Would be amazing if we can add x509Certificate2 signatures for PDF documents generated by SkDocument.CreatePdf().\r\n\r\n\u003C!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. --\u003E\r\nActually I didn\u0027t verified another way. I believe that using a new package just for this couldn\u0027t be good.\r\n\r\n\u003C!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you\u0027ve considered. --\u003E\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n\u003C!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. --\u003E\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n",
