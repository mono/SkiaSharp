  "body": "Hi, I\u0027m using SkiaSharp in my WPF app with WGL rendering as described here.\r\nhttps://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/issues/745 (GPU-accelerated WPF without WindowsFormsHost)\r\n\r\nFps of this approach is low(all performance is thrown into copy bytes to WritableBitmap), so I\u0027m in search for another solution and found an perfect example, how to render in WPF D3DImage over OpenGL via SharpDX, Angle.\r\nhttps://github.com/l3m/wpf-gles\r\n\r\nPerformance is on another level, but I\u0027m failing to connect this example to SkiaSharp.\r\nIs this possible at all?\r\nDid you ever considered this type of approach for WPF apps?\r\nIf this approach will connect to skia - it will be awesome!",
