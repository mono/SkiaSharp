  "body": "### Is your feature request related to a problem?\n\nI wanted to load images on Android (Net Maui) from the gallery, but it only seems to be working with .JPEG images, not .HEIC images (I didn\u0027t test .PNG and that kind of stuff yet).\n\n### Describe the solution you would like\n\nI would like to be able to decode heic images to a \u0060SKBitmap\u0060 object.\n\n### Describe alternatives you have considered\n\nNone, I hace no idea how this could be done.\n\n### Additional context\n\nFeature request https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/issues/1700 was close because of license issues, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61232393/open-heic-bitmap-file-in-skiasharp states that it isn\u0027t supported.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project\u0027s Code of Conduct",
