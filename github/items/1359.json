  "body": "**Description of Change**\r\n\r\nIn order to help the world get started with SkiaSharp on WASM, this PR will do the absolute minimum to get started. No views, no interop, no managed code at all. It just builds libSkiaSharp for WASM so that no one else has to deal with anything other than using it.\r\n\r\nThis artifact will be attached to the releases like the initial Linux builds were and can be pulled down and used. It will work with the code for the managed release. It is highly likely that there will be another intermediate PR that fixes the generate code (see #1333) so that it can actually work without modification, but small steps. \r\n\r\n\u003E There is a tiny example that was thrown together, making use of @UnoPlatform\u0027s bootstrapper. Special thanks to them for all their work in this regard.\r\n\r\n**Bugs Fixed**\r\n\r\n- Main WASM PR is #1333 \r\n- Relates to #1219 and #1194 \r\n\r\n",
