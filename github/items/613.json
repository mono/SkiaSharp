  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nIn the file https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/blob/7576a8714ff0d29f2d89658a1ed47b8775be0593/source/SkiaSharp.Views.Forms/SkiaSharp.Views.Forms.Android/SKTouchHandler.cs\r\n\r\nGetScaledCoord converts coordinates to a platform-specific scaled format.  While this is quite clever it is also remarkably difficult to use within the XF context.  I propose that on touch the touch location should be provided in both a scaled and unscaled format.  Failing that only unscaled values should be used.  This is related to feature-request/bug https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/issues/607\n\n\u003E VS bug [#736296](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/736296)",
