  "title": "[FEATURE]  Pressure Info from TouchEventArgs in SkCanvasView for Pen Inputs",
  "body": "I need to do pressure sensitive ink strokes from styluses like the surface pen or the apple pencil. The touch event from SkCanvasView already provides the device type (pen, mouse) and the touch action (pressed, moved) but does not show pressure info.\r\n\r\nSince the pen device type is also provided, it would be greate if it also holds the pressure information.\r\n\r\nMaybe even just a way to override the renderers to add more touch info will be great.\n\n\u003E VS bug [#770233](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/770233)",
