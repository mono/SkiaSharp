  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nCurrently, all **runtimes** are being generated in the output folder  - _Linux (x86/x64/ARM/MUSL), OSX, Windows (x86/x64/Arm64), Win7_ - which generates ~132 MB of space, when I only need Windows and Linux.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you\u0027d like**\r\n\r\nAs a user, I want to be able to select at compile time which **runtimes** are to be generated in the output folder. For instance, the required Windows x64 and Linux x64 files, reduce the output down to 21 MB.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you\u0027ve considered**\r\n\r\nManually delete the files before packaging. This needs to be performed across all of our projects which reference SkiaSharp.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nWe are using, Avalonia.Skia.dll",
