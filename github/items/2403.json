  "body": "I\u0027m creating an app with MAUI targeting all platforms but mainly Windows and Mac.\r\nSo far I\u0027ve used SKCanvasView with good results but I would like to use SKGLView for better performances.\r\n\r\nI\u0027ve tried to use it but the app crashes with this message:\r\nHandler not found for view SkiaSharp.Views.Maui.Controls.SKGLView.\r\n\r\nI\u0027ve installed the package SkiaSharp.Views.Maui.Controls.Compatibility hoping to use the previous renderers but without success.\r\n\r\nAm I missing something or it\u0027s not possible to use SKGLView with MAUI? If so, are there any plans for it?\r\n\r\nThank you very much.",
