  "title": "Use GPU when generating bitmaps",
  "body": "I am using SkiaSharp to generate bitmaps in a .NET Standard project. I would like to use hardware acceleration but it looks like all the hardware accelerated surfaces are in the platform dependent views. Do you have any advice how to do this? Is there perhaps a hardware accelerated surface in the core? Is this possible at all? Should I inject the platform dependent view? Or use bait and switch? ",
