  "body": "\u003C!--\r\n\r\nYou can ask questions here, but there might be better places to do that as well:\r\n\r\n - If you have questions on how to use SkiaSharp with .NET, this is the best place.\r\n - If you have questions on how to draw a picture, but need some suggestions, there is the community to help:\r\n    - StackOverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/skiasharp\r\n    - Xamarin Forums: https://forums.xamarin.com\r\n    - Gitter.im Chat: https://gitter.im/xamarin/XamarinComponents\r\n - If you have questions on skia, or need to ask more advanced questions about the native API, the skia Group is the place to go: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/skia-discuss\r\n\r\nBut... If you still aren\u0027t sure about where to ask your question, then go ahead and ask here! We will try and answer you, but if we can\u0027t, then we will help you get the answers you want.\r\n\r\n--\u003E\r\n\r\nHi, I\u0027m pretty new to the .NET aspects of C# and found this extension while trying to figure out how to draw images into the .NET Interactive notebook.  It looks so much better than \u0060relying on System.Drawing\u0060, thanks for publishing it @mattleibow !\r\n\r\nThis is the only info I found on install extensions. https://github.com/dotnet/interactive/blob/main/samples/extensions/ClockExtension.ipynb\r\n\r\nIn order to get the extension per the instructions on the ClockExtension notebook, do I need to clone the whole SkiaSharp repo or is there another way?\r\n",
