  "body": "**Description of Change**\r\n\r\n\u0060SKData.Create(Stream)\u0060 throws when the stream is non-seekable. This is because we need the length before we can allocate memory. And, we can\u0027t get the length.\r\n\r\nSo, we create a copy of the stream, get the length and then allocate the memory. \r\n\r\n\u003E It is a double copy, but that is unfortunately what we need to do.\r\n\r\n**Bugs Fixed**\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n**API Changes**\r\n\r\nNone.",
