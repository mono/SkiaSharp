  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nWe need a fast way to draw a good background blur. Now we are doing it ourselves - getting bad performance results.\r\nHere is a page with examples of what we want: https://webkit.org/blog/3632/introducing-backdrop-filters/\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you\u0027d like**\r\n\r\nI\u0027ve found a solution here: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/skia/issues/detail?id=4915\r\nSkia has this method https://api.skia.org/structSkCanvas_1_1SaveLayerRec.html\r\nCan SkiaSharp implement it?\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you\u0027ve considered**\r\nI think there is also a way to implement a shader that will do the same effect. But I didn\u0027t found any example how to do things like this. Also I have a super basic shader experience.\r\n",
