  "body": "Hi,\n\nWould be good if we have SkiaSharp working on general Mono instead of just on Xamarin iOS/Android. I know that nothing on current binding stop us to have it working on Mono however, build Skia native libs is a process not very well documented and with lots of tricks. If we could have guide on how to build it (at least the SkiaSharp fork) to ARMv6/v7 and other platforms, would be perfect.\n\nAs SkiaSharp home page said, we have lots of problems with Cairo that just can\u0027t be fixed today so would be perfect to remove it with Skia and SkiaSharp.\n\nGood work!\n\nThanks!\n",
