  "title": "Migrate GPU surface descriptors to new types",
  "body": "With the update of m67, skia has changed the way GPU surfaces are created.\r\n\r\n - \u0060GRBackendRenderTargetDesc\u0060 has been replaced with \u0060GRBackendRenderTarget\u0060\r\n - \u0060GRBackendTextureDesc\u0060/\u0060GRGlBackendTextureDesc\u0060 has been replaced with \u0060GRBackendTexture\u0060\r\n\r\nI have ensured that there is 100% backwards compatibility with the previous API, but I cannot say for how long this will be able to work as Google may introduce a breaking change.\r\n\r\nThe various views (both native and Xamarin.Forms) need to be updated to use these new types. They currently work, but will give many obsolete warnings.",
