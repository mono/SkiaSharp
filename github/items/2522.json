  "title": "[QUESTION] Is it possible to downgrade OpenGL Version?",
  "body": "I have a question with SKGLControl on Winforms in particular. Some people on older PCs crash immediately on the startup of my program (the stack traces are not helpful, indicates an internal runtime issue in coreclr runtime), and I believe it is due to older OpenGL versions based on some information I\u0027ve gathered in several cases.\r\n\r\nLatest person in particular had a 2nd gen core i3 processor, which I think only support 3.1.\r\n\r\nWhat is the minimum supported version currently, and is there a way to support older computers/hardware? I already tried using SKControl, but the performance loss is too costly.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
