  "title": "[BUG] Unable to load shared library \u0027libSkiaSharp\u0027 or one of its dependencies in AWS Linux",
  "body": "**Description**\r\n\r\nI built out a .NET Core 2.1 API that uses SkiaSharp. Works great on Windows \u0026 Mac. Deployed to AWS Amazon Linux 2 (Amazon\u0027s custom version of CentOS). When I hit the endpoint, I get: \r\n\r\n\u003E Unable to load shared library \u0027libSkiaSharp\u0027 or one of its dependencies. In order to help diagnose loading problems, consider setting the LD_DEBUG environment variable: liblibSkiaSharp: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\r\n\r\nI\u0027ve already added [SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.Linux](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.Linux) to my project. I tried putting \u0060libSkiaSharp.so\u0060 in my bin folder to no avail.\r\n\r\nI took the error\u0027s advice and enabled LD_DEBUG and found the following:\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n7332:     find library=libSkiaSharp [0]; searching\r\n7332:      search cache=/etc/ld.so.cache\r\n7332:      search path=/lib64/tls:/lib64:/usr/lib64/tls:/usr/lib64(system search path)\r\n7332:trying file=/lib64/tls/libSkiaSharp\r\n7332:trying file=/lib64/libSkiaSharp\r\n7332:trying file=/usr/lib64/tls/libSkiaSharp\r\n7332:trying file=/usr/lib64/libSkiaSharp\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\nSo I copied \u0060libSkiaSharp.so\u0060 to \u0060/usr/lib64\u0060 and then it started working! But this isn\u0027t ideal in my production environment, and I\u0027d much rather it just look locally as opposed to deep in the system. Is there somewhere else I can put it without needing to access the AWS machine it\u0027s running on?",
