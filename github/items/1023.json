  "body": "**Description of Change**\r\n\r\nSeems that when colors go into the native world and back, we aren\u0027t passing it correctly.\r\n\r\nThis issue keeps coming up when I update the native interop. I add tests that catch it, but it looks like every time I update, I do something to bypass the tests. I am writing bad tests then.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this time is because I switched to the new interop generator, but the rules for \u0060SKColor\u0060 are special. When being passed INTO a method as arguments, then you can just pass \u0060SKColor\u0060 (the struct) directly. But, as part of a RETURN, you have to use the actual \u0060uint\u0060. This is all because we are working with a nice struct on the managed side, but in the native side it is just a \u0060uint\u0060.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I just switch to \u0060uint\u0060 everywhere, except for arrays where I explicitly cast from \u0060SKColor*\u0060 to \u0060uint*\u0060 so nothing can break accidentally.\r\n\r\n**Bugs Fixed**\r\n\r\n- Fixes #1017 \r\n- Related to #307\r\n- Related to #143 \r\n\r\n**API Changes**\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n**Behavioral Changes**\r\n\r\nCorrect colors.\r\n\r\n**PR Checklist**\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has tests (if omitted, state reason in description)\r\n- [ ] Rebased on top of master at time of PR\r\n- [ ] Changes adhere to coding standard\r\n- [ ] Updated documentation\r\n",
