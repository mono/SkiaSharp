  "title": "NEW: SkiaSharp Views \u0026 Layers (WIP)",
  "body": "Hey SkiaSharp users/developers! I am busy putting together a set of views and layers and stuff to help you get started with SkiaSharp. Right now I am busy getting everything together so the code is a quicksand, but here is the branch: \n\n\u003E https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/tree/skiasharp-views\n\nCheck out the \u0060views\u0060 folder in the root for the actual code. \nThere are also \u0022samples\u0022 in the \u0060samples/BasicSamples\u0060 folder. These try to show how you would \u0022set up\u0022 the views.\n\nAs of now, the GL bits aren\u0027t there yet for Mac (I need to go to sleep, but when I wake... that is what I am going to do next). But, everything seems to be \u0022working\u0022 for iOS/tvOS (both raster and GL) and the raster stuff is there for Mac. As I said, it is still very much a work-in-progress.\n\nPlease feel free to add any comments and suggestions here or on the forums: http://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/76293/new-skiasharp-views-layers-wip\n\nNOTE: The code uses NuGets, so you don\u0027t need to build the native libraries (although right now the \u0060GRContext.Flush\u0060 method is not yet in the public NuGet API, so you can comment it out while you dev)\n",
