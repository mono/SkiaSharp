  "body": "\u0060SKPixMap.GetPixelSpan\u0060 returns a  \u0060ReadOnlySpan\u003Cbyte\u003E\u0060, not a \u0060Span\u003Cbyte\u003E\u0060\r\n\r\nSo one can\u0027t use that for direct pixel manipulation.\r\n\r\nIs this by design? I believe a pix-map is writable no?\r\n\r\nSkia itself also has \u0060void* SKPixMap::writable_addr() \u0060.\r\n\r\nIt would also be useful to have a generic version, to avoid having to call \u0060MemoryMarshal\u0060 methods\r\n",
