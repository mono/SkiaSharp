  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nPCL project used as shared project for a Xamarin Forms application.  Currently using SkiaSharp 1.60.0\r\n\r\nWhen I attempt to update to 1.60.2 I get the following error:\r\n\r\nCould not install package \u0027SkiaSharp 1.60.2\u0027. You are trying to install this package into a project that targets \u0027.NETPortable,Version=v4.5,Profile=Profile111\u0027, but the package does not contain any assembly references or content files that are compatible with that framework. For more information, contact the package author.\r\n\r\nPCL project is targeting .NETPortable,Version=v4.5,Profile=Profile111\r\n\r\nYou can add netstandard references to PCL projects, so fix should be a case of adding the netstandard libraries into the PCL folder within the NuGet?\r\n\r\nThis also seems to impact SkiaSharp.Views and SkiaSharp.Views.Forms, which I also use.",
