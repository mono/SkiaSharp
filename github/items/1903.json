  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am using SkiaSharp to render graphics, and I need to be able to read the pixel data back in system memory. I have got this working using SkImage\u0027s ReadPixels method, however this of course stalls the render thread while it copies the data. I have looked at the Skia documentation and see that there is a asyncRescaleAndReadPixels and even asyncRescaleAndReadPixelsYUV420 methods (Which would be very helpful for what I\u0027m trying to do), however they are seemingly not currently implemented in SkiaSharp. \r\n\r\nMy question is two fold:\r\n\r\n1. Is there any plan to implement these methods in SkiaSharp?\r\n2. Is there anyway at the moment that I can get access to the underlying OpenGL Context and use the native ReadPixels into two Pixel Buffer objects (Swapping on each frame). \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any help on this.\r\n\r\nJoe de Max\r\nCentral Control",
