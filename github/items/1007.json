  "body": "**Description of Change**\r\n\r\nSwitch to using Clang 9 instead of MSVC for Win32 builds.\r\n\r\n**Bugs Fixed**\r\n\r\n- Resolves #758 \r\n- Related to #686 \r\n\r\n**API Changes**\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n**Behavioral Changes**\r\n\r\nThere shouldn\u0027t be any visible _changes_ except for performance improvements. Google has been optimizing skia for Clang, and as a result the MSVC binaries are significantly slower. With this PR, we are using Clang on Windows desktop/Win32 so we get all those improvements now.\r\n\r\nUWP is still using MSVC, but that will be changed at a later stage.\r\n\r\n**PR Checklist**\r\n\r\n- [x] Has tests (if omitted, state reason in description)\r\n- [x] Rebased on top of master at time of PR\r\n- [x] Changes adhere to coding standard\r\n- [x] Updated documentation\r\n",
