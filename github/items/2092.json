  "body": "**Description of Change**\r\n\r\nReplace all the \u0022classic\u0022 SkiaSharp.* and HarfBuzzSharp.* projects with a single one. This makes merging the #2091 PR much easier since we will need to add 14 projects or just 4 if we do this.\r\n\r\nOne day I will do the same for the Xamarin.Forms and SkiaSharp.Views projects, but for now this is just the core.\r\n\r\nAnd in the very nice future we can just delete these projects and just use .NET 6 - but that is probably 10 years away.",
