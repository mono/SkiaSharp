  "title": "[FEATURE] SVG Control like FFImageLoading for xamarin forms",
  "body": "I am sure this has been asked before, many developers out there currently use FFImageLoading to support SVG in xamarin forms app, that fantastic nuget I dont think is currently been worked on anymore.\r\n\r\nIs there any chance to create an SVG control that we can use in xamarin forms that is owned by either the Xamarin team or the xamarin community toolkit.\r\n\r\nDread to think if new versions or android-ios etc.. break FFImageloading and we are stuck.\r\n\r\nmany thanks",
