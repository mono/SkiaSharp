  "body": "Updated the legal files:\r\n - The \u0060ThirdPartyNotices\u0060 file already exists: \u0060External-Dependency-Info.txt\u0060\r\n - The \u0060LICENSE\u0060 file that was added is just for docs, so I moved it to the docs folder: \u0060docs/LICENSE.txt\u0060\r\n - Removed the \u0060LICENSE-CODE\u0060 file as this is a code repo and the code license is more important than the docs. Also, the license was incorrect as we are Xamarin and Microsoft licenses, not Apache\r\n\r\n@mikekinsman and @redth, could you review this?",
