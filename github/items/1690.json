  "title": "Use of Content.Link tags in targets file for nuget generates unnecessary copies during publish of webapp",
  "body": "Due to the special relationship between Content with Link\u0027s and the publish operation of a web-app, you end up getting copies of all binaries in the target-file in the root of the published result, in addition to the ones you actually need in the bin folder. \r\n\r\nTweaking your targetfile to use something else, like None with a Link seemed to be enough to still get it to the bin-folder without the un-necessary copies, at least on my machine.\r\nAlso, you could probably solve it somehow with ContentWithTargetPath, which also doesnt seem to have a special relationship with the publish operation of web-apps.\r\n\r\nBest Regards",
