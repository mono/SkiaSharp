  "body": "I am interested in using Skia\u0027s SkSG (scene graph) module.\r\n\r\nIs there a reason (other than lack of need) SkiaSharp doesn\u0027t have bindings for the scene graph module for anything but the \u0060InvalidatonController\u0060?\r\n\r\nHow would one go about producing bindings for that module?  What are the guidelines on how to map c\u002B\u002B class hierarchies in c#?",
