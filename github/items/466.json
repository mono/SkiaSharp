  "title": "[WIP] Replacing Cake with PowerShell and MSBuild",
  "body": "The Cake script are nice and all that, but they are getting long and force dependencies unnecessarily. For example, to just build the Linux native files, mono and .NET Core has to be installed.\r\n\r\nThis PR hopes to do away with the Cake scripts and:\r\n - [ ] have a PowerShell script that will build all the externals\r\n - [ ] a single MSBuild invocation will compile the managed libraries and the docs\r\n - [ ] a single MSBuild invocation for packaging all the NuGets\r\n - [ ] a single MSBuild invocation will run the tests\r\n - [ ] a single MSBuild invocation for all the samples",
