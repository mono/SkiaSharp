  "title": "SKGLView - DrawRect resulting in a black screen",
  "body": "canvas.DrawRect doesn\u0027t appear to be working consistently with SKGLView. I am drawing a bunch of rectangles in a loop and everything works great using rectangles with a regular SKCanvasView. Also, interestingly enough, DrawRoundRect works as a substitute with GLView as long as the rounding radius provided is greater than 0.\r\n\r\n                canvas.DrawRect(rect, paint); // Doesn\u0027t show in GL\r\n                canvas.DrawRoundRect(rect, 1, 1, paint); // Shows in either\r\n                canvas.DrawRoundRect(rect, 0, 0, paint); // Doesn\u0027t show in GL\r\n\r\nI am using version 1.57.1 installed from Nuget. \r\n\r\n\r\n**=========== Current work around using SKPath ==============**\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\nusing (var path = new SKPath()) {\r\n\tpath.FillType = SKPathFillType.EvenOdd;\r\n\t\r\n\t\u0022loop each draw object\u0022\r\n\t{\r\n        \tpath.Reset();\r\n        \tpath.AddRect(rect);\r\n        \tcanvas.DrawPath(path, paint);\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\n_This leads me to believe there is suspect code within how DrawRect creates the underlying path, if that is how it does the drawing under the hood - haven\u0027t looked yet though._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
