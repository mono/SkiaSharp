  "body": "Hi! My first time using github to report :)\r\n\r\nI\u0027m experimenting with the method \u0022SKCanvasView.OnTouch\u0022 under UWP, and it seems like e.Handled is not working.\r\n\r\nI have a SKCanvasView inside a ListView item, and I want it to capture the input events, but they are propagated to the ListView item (and it gets animated and selected if I click in my SKCanvasView).\r\n\r\nAs I see [in this file](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/blob/master/source/SkiaSharp.Views.Forms/SkiaSharp.Views.Forms.UWP/SKTouchHandler.cs), it seems that the logic to stop the propagation is not implemented. The method \u0022CommonHandler\u0022 returns the value correctly, but the UWP events ignore it.\r\n\r\nAs I see in the UWP documentation, it should be copied to \u0022PointerRoutedEventArgs.Handled\u0022.\r\n\r\nAm I right or am I missing something?\r\n\r\nThank you!",
