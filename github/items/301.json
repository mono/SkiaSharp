  "title": "After latest Xamarin.Forms update, SkiaSharp will not install.",
  "body": "I have just been forced to get the latest Xamarin extension inside Visual Studio 2015 and also updated Xamarin.Forms via nugget to V 2.3.4.247.  I tried to update SkiaSharp to 1.58.0 at the same time but this now fails.  Trying to go back to 1.57.1 also now fails with the same error message:\r\n\r\nPackage \u0027SkiaSharp.Views.1.57.1 : SkiaSharp [1.57.1, )\u0027 does not exist in folder \u0027D:\\Data\\Work\\Dev\\Projects\\Live\\MyProject\\packages\u0027\r\nCould not install package \u0027SkiaSharp.Views 1.57.1\u0027. You are trying to install this package into a project that targets \u0027.NETPortable,Version=v4.5,Profile=Profile111\u0027, but the package does not contain any assembly references or content files that are compatible with that framework. For more information, contact the package author.\r\n\r\nAs things stand, this is a show-stopper, so I\u0027d be very grateful for a workaround or fix.\r\n",
