  "body": "## Summary\n\nImproves the native-dependency-update skill to prevent build failures from missing source files.\n\n## Problem\n\nDuring the libwebp 1.3.2\u21921.6.0 update, a partial check of only \u0060src/dec\u0060, \u0060src/enc\u0060, \u0060src/dsp\u0060 directories missed the new \u0060src/utils/palette.c\u0060 file. This caused a link failure that could have been caught during analysis.\n\nThe flawed approach was assuming a \u0060src/\u0060 directory exists and filtering by specific subdirectories.\n\n## Solution\n\nAdd a mandatory source file verification procedure that:\n\n1. Gets **ALL** added/deleted files without any path filtering first\n2. Cross-references against BUILD.gn to identify what actually needs updating\n3. Documents the correct approach with a concrete example\n\n## Changes\n\n- \u0060.github/skills/native-dependency-update/SKILL.md\u0060 - Added Step 1a/1b/1c verification procedure\n- \u0060.github/skills/native-dependency-update/references/breaking-changes.md\u0060 - Added detailed verification guidance",
