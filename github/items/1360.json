  "body": "**Description of Change**\r\n\r\nFor some reason the \u0060\u003CCopy /\u003E\u0060 MSBuild task tries to copy files that it should have skipped due to it existing already. The \u0060_CopyToOutputDirectoryDep\u0060 task is already using the correct inputs/outputs, but I suspect that using \u0060AfterTargets\u0060 to control the steps is not correct and should be a \u0060DependsOnTargets\u0060 for the build process.\r\n\r\nHowever, since we are near release time, a simple retry might just be what it takes.\r\n\r\n\u003E This only happens on Windows because macOS and Linux do not support parallel builds.",
