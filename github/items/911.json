  "title": "[FEATURE] Add Getting Started to Readme.md",
  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nI am just starting with using SkiaSharp and the first thing I noticed was it wasn\u0027t obvious as to where to go to get started.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you\u0027d like**\r\nCould we add a \u0022Getting Started\u0022 to the readme.md?  it could be something like:\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\n[Introduction to SkiaSharp](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/graphics-games/skiasharp/introduction)\r\n#### Tutorials\r\n[Xamarin Forms](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/xamarin/deep-dive-skiasharp-xamarin-forms/)\r\n[WPF]\r\netc...\r\n#### Api Docs\r\n[Skia Api](https://skia.org/)\r\n\r\nIt would be something to help users find resources for using SkiaSharp and link them to the docs and api.  I\u0027d be happy to collaborate on this and help out.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you\u0027ve considered**\r\nAlternatives could be to just leave the readme as it is.  There are plenty of resources out there, but I think it\u0027d might be nice to categorize/centralize the resources for getting started.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nNA\r\n",
