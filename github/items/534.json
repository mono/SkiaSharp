  "title": "SKWidget for GTK# (on Linux) is rendering kind of slow",
  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nThis is a continuation of #462 .  That ticket\u0027s main issue has been solved, but it\u0027s been reported that the rendering of the \u0060SKWidget\u0060, on such events such as a window/widget resize are slow and produce flickering.  See for example:\r\n![skiasharp-not-so-smooth](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4551425/40593046-89891d68-61f3-11e8-8973-80437eceb815.gif)\r\n\r\n(This is using SkiaSharp 1.60.1 off of NuGet, and the linux \u0060.so\u0060 files from this project\u0027s release page).\r\n\r\n### Code\r\n\r\nThe code used is the same one as here: https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/blob/master/samples/Basic/Gtk/SkiaSharpSample/MainWindow.cs\r\n\r\nThe only different that I applied to (in that widget) is in the GUI designer, I set the Box Layout child properties of the \u0060SKWidget\u0060 to \u0060auto fill=false, expanding=true, fill=true\u0060.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nShould be MUCH smoother, such as when using Cairo for rendering.  In fact, Skia typically renders faster than Cairo.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n[see above GIF]",
