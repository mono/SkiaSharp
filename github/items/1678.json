If you need to add the compatibility renderers, the \u0060UseSkiaSharpCompatibilityRenderers\u0060 is also needed. Order matters and the last one wins. For a hybrid approach, use compatibility first as this will register the compat views and image sources, but then overwrite the ones with the new handlers:\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060csharp\r\npublic void Configure(IAppHostBuilder appBuilder) =\u003E\r\n\tappBuilder\r\n\t\t.UseSkiaSharpCompatibilityRenderers()\r\n\t\t.UseSkiaSharpHandlers()\r\n\t\t.UseMauiApp\u003CApp\u003E();\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\n\r\n",
