  "body": "**Description of Change**\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the initial bits to get .NET Interactive support.\r\n\r\nThe generated HTML needs more love. The colors are mostly OK, but the images might cause things to overflow and might also be useful to add additional info - like dimensions, byte sizes and color types.\r\n\r\n**Bugs Fixed**\r\n\r\n- Fixes #1581\r\n\r\n**API Changes**\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n**Behavioral Changes**\r\n\r\nNone. There is a new dll in the main SkiaSharp package, but that should in no way affect anything.\r\n\r\n**PR Checklist**\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has tests (if omitted, state reason in description)\r\n- [ ] Rebased on top of main at time of PR\r\n- [ ] Changes adhere to coding standard\r\n- [ ] Updated documentation\r\n",
