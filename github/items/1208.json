  "body": "Just FYI, \r\n\r\nwe are very, very grateful that this library exists. We\u0027ve waited several years for such a project to emerge in the .NET landscape.\r\n\r\nToday, SkiaSharp is the basis of the graph editor, HelpBrowser and several other parts of the UI of our new visual programming language for the .NET ecosystem. It was released just a few days ago:\r\n\r\nhttps://visualprogramming.net/\r\n\r\nWe\u0027ve also created an extensive node library that covers almost all features of SkiaSharp. This might be one of the most interactive and fun way to play around with SkiaSharp:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1094716/78370114-82ffd480-75c6-11ea-8589-becc877f829a.png)\r\n\r\nIt comes with many HowTo\u0027s:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1094716/78372960-36b69380-75ca-11ea-87c0-93d311b150d1.png)\r\n\r\nthat look like this:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1094716/78373323-c0fef780-75ca-11ea-95ea-9592f527da56.png)\r\n \r\nIs there any place where you gather projects that use SkiaSharp?",
