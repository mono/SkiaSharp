# SkiaSharp Graphics in .NET MAUI

_Use SkiaSharp for 2D graphics in your .NET MAUI applications_

SkiaSharp is a 2D graphics system for .NET and C# powered by the open-source Skia graphics engine that is used extensively in Google products. You can use SkiaSharp in your .NET MAUI applications to draw 2D vector graphics, bitmaps, and text.

This guide assumes that you are familiar with .NET MAUI programming.

## SkiaSharp Preliminaries

SkiaSharp for .NET MAUI is packaged as a NuGet package. After you've created a .NET MAUI solution in Visual Studio or Visual Studio for Mac, you can use the NuGet package manager to search for the **SkiaSharp.Views.Maui.Controls** package and add it to your solution. If you check the **References** section of your project after adding SkiaSharp, you can see that various **SkiaSharp** libraries have been added to your project.

If your .NET MAUI application targets iOS, make sure your project targets iOS 11.0 or later as the minimum deployment target.

In any C# page that uses SkiaSharp you'll want to include a `using` directive for the [`SkiaSharp`](xref:SkiaSharp) namespace, which encompasses all the SkiaSharp classes, structures, and enumerations that you'll use in your graphics programming. You'll also want a `using` directive for the [`SkiaSharp.Views.Maui.Controls`](xref:SkiaSharp.Views.Maui.Controls) namespace for the classes specific to .NET MAUI. This is a much smaller namespace, with the most important class being [`SKCanvasView`](xref:SkiaSharp.Views.Maui.Controls.SKCanvasView). This class derives from the .NET MAUI `View` class and hosts your SkiaSharp graphics output.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `SkiaSharp.Views.Maui.Controls` namespace also contains an `SKGLView` class that derives from `View` but uses OpenGL for rendering graphics. For purposes of simplicity, this guide restricts itself to `SKCanvasView`, but using `SKGLView` instead is quite similar.

## [SkiaSharp Drawing Basics](docs/basics/index.md)

Some of the simplest graphics figures you can draw with SkiaSharp are circles, ovals, and rectangles. In displaying these figures, you will learn about SkiaSharp coordinates, sizes, and colors. The display of text and bitmaps is more complex, but these articles also introduce those techniques.

## [SkiaSharp Lines and Paths](docs/paths/index.md)

A graphics path is a series of connected straight lines and curves. Paths can be stroked, filled, or both. This article encompasses many aspects of line drawing, including stroke ends and joins, and dashed and dotted lines, but stops short of curve geometries.

## [SkiaSharp Transforms](docs/transforms/index.md)

Transforms allow graphics objects to be uniformly translated, scaled, rotated, or skewed. This article also shows how you can use a standard 3-by-3 transform matrix for creating non-affine transforms and applying transforms to paths.

## [SkiaSharp Curves and Paths](docs/curves/index.md)

The exploration of paths continues with adding curves to a path objects, and exploiting other powerful path features. You'll see how you can specify an entire path in a concise text string, how to use path effects, and how to dig into path internals.

## [SkiaSharp Bitmaps](docs/bitmaps/index.md)

Bitmaps are rectangular arrays of bits corresponding to the pixels of a display device. This series of articles shows how to load, save, display, create, draw on, animate, and access the bits of SkiaSharp bitmaps.

## [SkiaSharp Effects](docs/effects/index.md)

Effects are properties that alter the normal display of graphics, including linear and circular gradients, bitmap tiling, blend modes, blur, and others.
