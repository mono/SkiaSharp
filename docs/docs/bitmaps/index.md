# SkiaSharp bitmaps

A bitmap is a rectangular array of data corresponding to the pixels of a display device. The area of graphics programming associated with bitmaps is sometimes called _raster graphics_ (named after the scan lines of early video displays) in contrast to the _vector graphics_ of lines and curves. 

The article **[Bitmap Basics in SkiaSharp](../basics/bitmaps.md)** described some of the fundamentals of loading and displaying bitmaps. These articles expand on the concepts in that introductory article:

## [Displaying SkiaSharp bitmaps](displaying.md)

Learn how to display SkiaSharp bitmaps in their native pixel sizes or expanded to fill to rectangles while preserving the aspect ratio.

## [Creating and drawing on SkiaSharp bitmaps](drawing.md)

Learn how to create SkiaSharp bitmaps and then draw on these bitmaps by creating a canvas using the bitmap as a drawing surface.

## [Cropping SkiaSharp bitmaps](cropping.md)

Learn how to use SkiaSharp to design a user interface for interactively describing a cropping rectangle.

## [Segmented display of SkiaSharp bitmaps](segmented.md)

Discover the specialized nine-patch and lattice options for rendering bitmaps.

## [Saving SkiaSharp bitmaps to files](saving.md)

Save bitmaps in the user's photo library.

## [Accessing SkiaSharp bitmap pixel bits](pixel-bits.md)

Discover the various techniques for accessing and modifying the pixel bits of SkiaSharp bitmaps.

## [Animating SkiaSharp bitmaps](animating.md)

Learn how to perform bitmap animation by sequentially displaying different bitmaps, and rendering animated GIF bitmaps.
