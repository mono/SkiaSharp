# SkiaSharp Curves and Paths

_Learn how to use SkiaSharp to draw curves and use path features_

The exploration of [`SKPath`](xref:SkiaSharp.SKPath) methods and properties began in the [**SkiaSharp Lines and Paths**](../paths/index.md) article. The articles here continue with methods that add curves to an `SKPath` object, and exploit other powerful path features. You'll see how you can specify an entire path in a concise text string, how to use path effects, and how to dig into path internals.

All the sample programs in this section can be found in the **SkiaSharp Curves and Paths** page of the sample program, and in the [**Curves**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-samples/tree/master/SkiaSharpForms/Demos/Demos/SkiaSharpFormsDemos/Curves) folder of the solution.
