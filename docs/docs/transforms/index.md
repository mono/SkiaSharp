# SkiaSharp Transforms

_Learn about transforms for displaying SkiaSharp graphics_

SkiaSharp supports traditional graphics transforms that are implemented as methods of the [`SKCanvas`](xref:SkiaSharp.SKCanvas) object. Mathematically, transforms alter the coordinates and sizes that you specify in `SKCanvas` drawing functions as the graphical objects are rendered. Transforms are often convenient for drawing repetitive graphics or for animation. Some techniques &mdash; such as rotating bitmaps or text &mdash; are not possible without the use of transforms.

SkiaSharp transforms support the following operations:

- *Translate* to shift coordinates from one location to another
- *Scale* to increase or decrease coordinates and sizes
- *Rotate* to rotate coordinates around a point
- *Skew* to shift coordinates horizontally or vertically so that a rectangle becomes a parallelogram

These are known as *affine* transforms. Affine transforms always preserve parallel lines and never cause a coordinate or size to become infinite. A square is never transformed into anything other than a parallelogram, and a circle is never transformed into anything other than an ellipse.

SkiaSharp also supports non-affine transforms (also called *projective* or *perspective* transforms) based on a standard 3-by-3 transform matrix. A non-affine transform allows a square to be transformed into any convex quadrilateral, which is a four-sided figure with all interior angles less than 180 degrees. Non-affine transforms can cause coordinates or sizes to become infinite, but they are vital for 3D effects.

## Differences between SkiaSharp and Xamarin.Forms Transforms

Xamarin.Forms also supports transforms that are similar to those in SkiaSharp. The Xamarin.Forms [`VisualElement`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.VisualElement) class defines the following transform properties:

- [`TranslationX`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.VisualElement.TranslationX) and [`TranslationY`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.VisualElement.TranslationY)
- [`Scale`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.VisualElement.Scale)
- [`Rotation`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.VisualElement.Rotation), [`RotationX`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.VisualElement.RotationX), and [`RotationY`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.VisualElement.RotationY)

The `RotationX` and `RotationY` properties are perspective transforms that create quasi-3D effects.

There are several crucial differences between SkiaSharp transforms and Xamarin.Forms transforms:

The first difference is that SkiaSharp transforms are applied to the entire `SKCanvas` object while the .NET MAUI transforms are applied to individual `VisualElement` derivatives. (You can apply the .NET MAUI transforms to the `SKCanvasView` object itself, because `SKCanvasView` derives from `VisualElement`, but within that `SKCanvasView`, the SkiaSkarp transforms apply.)

The SkiaSharp transforms are relative to the upper-left corner of the `SKCanvas` while Xamarin.Forms transforms are relative to the upper-left corner of the `VisualElement` to which they are applied. This difference is important when applying scaling and rotation transforms because these transforms are always relative to a particular point.

The really big difference is that SKiaSharp transforms are *methods* while the .NET MAUI transforms are *properties*. This is a semantic difference beyond the syntactical difference: SkiaSharp transforms perform an operation while Xamarin.Forms transforms set a state. SkiaSharp transforms apply to subsequently drawn graphics objects, but not to graphics objects that are drawn before the transform is applied. In contrast, a .NET MAUI transform applies to a previously rendered element as soon as the property is set. SkiaSharp transforms are cumulative as the methods are called; Xamarin.Forms transforms are replaced when the property is set with another value.

All the sample programs in this section appear in the **SkiaSharp Transforms** section of the sample program. Source code can be found in the [**Transforms**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-samples/tree/master/SkiaSharpForms/Demos/Demos/SkiaSharpFormsDemos/Transforms) folder of the solution.
