# SkiaSharp shaders

You can set the [`Shader`](xref:SkiaSharp.SKPaint.Shader) property of `SKPaint` to an object of type [`SKShader`](xref:SkiaSharp.SKShader) to create several types of gradients, a tiled bitmap pattern, or Perlin noise.

## [The SkiaSharp linear gradient](linear-gradient.md)

Discover how to stroke lines or fill areas with gradients composed of a gradual blend of two colors.

## [SkiaSharp circular gradients](circular-gradients.md)

Learn about the different types of gradients based on circles, and use them for masks or specular highlights.

## [SkiaSharp bitmap tiling](bitmap-tiling.md)

Tile an area using bitmaps repeated horizontally and vertically.

## [SkiaSharp noise and composing](noise.md)

Generate Perlin noise shaders and combine with other shaders.
