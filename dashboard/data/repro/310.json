  "notes": "This bug requires Windows with WinForms GUI to reproduce. The SKControl.OnPaint method (source/SkiaSharp.Views/SkiaSharp.Views.WindowsForms/SKControl.cs:30-57) calls LockBits, fires PaintSurface (user code), then UnlockBits. If user code triggers a re-entrant OnPaint (e.g. by resizing the control), CreateBitmap() disposes and recreates the locked bitmap, causing UnlockBits to throw ExternalException on the stale BitmapData reference. Code review of main confirms no re-entrancy guard has been added \u2014 the bug still exists. The reporter thoroughly investigated and confirmed the re-entrancy as the root cause. A boolean guard (e.g. \u0027if (isPainting) return;\u0027) in OnPaint would prevent the crash.",
