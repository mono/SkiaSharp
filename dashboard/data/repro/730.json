  "notes": "Cannot reproduce: bug requires Windows UWP with Xamarin.Forms and ANGLE/EGL OpenGL backend (SKGLView \u002B AngleSwapChainPanel). Current environment is macOS arm64 which cannot run UWP apps. The NuGet package (1.68.0-preview28) was verified to exist with uap10.0 TFM and ANGLE native binaries (libEGL.dll, libGLESv2.dll) for win10-x64/x86/arm. Triage indicates PR #1642 (merged 2021-03-30) likely addressed the root cause by making the EGL display static with initialize-once semantics and adding composition scale change deduplication. UWP and Xamarin.Forms are now deprecated platforms.",
