  "notes": "This bug requires Windows with UWP (Universal Windows Platform) and the ANGLE OpenGL ES emulation layer. The crash occurs in SkiaSharp.Views.UWP.AngleSwapChainPanel.EnsureRenderSurface() when a parent Xamarin.Forms view is rotated via ViewExtensions.RotateYTo, causing the EGL surface to become invalid. The entire reproduction stack \u2014 SKGLView on UWP, AngleSwapChainPanel, GlesContext, SwapChainPanel composition events, and Xamarin.Forms UWP \u2014 is unavailable on macOS. The relevant source code (AngleSwapChainPanel.cs, GlesContext.cs) exists in the SkiaSharp codebase under SkiaSharp.Views.WinUI, confirming this is a real code path but one that can only execute on Windows.",
