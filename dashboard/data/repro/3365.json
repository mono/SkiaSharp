  "notes": "Confirmed: libSkiaSharp.dll has a hard link-time import of d3d12.dll and D3DCOMPILER_47.dll starting from SkiaSharp 3.119.0. No delay-load is configured. On Windows systems without DX12 support, the DLL loader will fail before any SkiaSharp code executes. Version discrepancy: the reporter stated 3.116.0, but PE import analysis shows 3.116.0 does NOT have the d3d12 dependency \u2014 it was introduced in 3.119.0. The bug is real and affects the latest stable release (3.119.2) and main branch. The build config (native/windows/build.cake) defaults SUPPORT_DIRECT3D to true, and CheckWindowsDependencies only excludes VCRUNTIME/MSVCP, so d3d12 is not flagged.",
