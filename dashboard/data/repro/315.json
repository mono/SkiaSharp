Xamarin.Forms is end-of-life, its templates are not available in modern .NET SDKs, and SkiaSharp.Views.Forms has been completely removed from the codebase (last published version 2.88.9 targets monoandroid1.0/xamarinios1.0 only). The package contains no netstandard or net8.0 TFMs, so it cannot be used in current .NET projects. Even if the package could be referenced, reproducing the gesture conflict requires an Android device with touch input \u2014 macOS cannot simulate this.",
