  "notes": "Issue #533 reports uncapped framerates (300-1000fps) on Android when using SKGLView with HasRenderLoop=true after upgrading from SkiaSharp 1.59.3 to 1.60.1. The root cause is that GLTextureView.cs (custom GL threading implementation) does not call eglSwapInterval for VSync, whereas the previously-used Android GLSurfaceView framework class handled VSync internally. Code inspection of the current source confirms no eglSwapInterval or Choreographer-based frame pacing exists in GLTextureView.cs. The MAUI SKGLViewHandler on Android still uses SKGLTextureView with Rendermode.Continuously. Reproducing this bug requires running on an Android device or emulator to measure actual framerate \u2014 no Android tooling (emulator, adb) is available in the current macOS environment. The reporter\u0027s version (SkiaSharp.Views.Forms 1.60.1) targets Xamarin.Forms (MonoAndroid/netstandard1.3) and is incompatible with modern .NET 8.0.",
