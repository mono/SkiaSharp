  "notes": "Issue reports that SKPaint constructor crashes on iOS physical device with \u0027@rpath/libSkiaSharp.framework/libSkiaSharp\u0027 native loading error. Works on iOS simulator and Android. Reproduced the native loading on macOS console successfully with both 2.88.3 and 3.119.2 \u2014 SKPaint creates without error. Attempted to build a MAUI project targeting iOS with 2.88.3 NativeAssets but the build itself failed because the 2.88.3 iOS native assets contain device-only binaries (built for \u0027iOS\u0027 not \u0027iOS-simulator\u0027), confirming the framework packaging issue. The actual crash requires deploying to a physical iOS device to observe the @rpath resolution failure. No iOS device is available in this environment.",
