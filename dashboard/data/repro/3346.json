SkiaSharp.Views.WinUI.Native.dll in SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.WinUI 3.116.0 (win-arm64) dynamically links MSVCP140.dll and VCRUNTIME140.dll, which are absent on fresh Windows ARM64 machines without VC\u002B\u002B Redistributable. This dependency is removed in 3.119.2 \u2014 objdump confirms only KERNEL32.dll and OLEAUT32.dll imports remain. Build-time CheckWindowsDependencies verification (PR #3510) exists on main to prevent regression. Could not observe the actual runtime crash because reproduction requires Windows ARM64.",
