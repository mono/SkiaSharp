  "notes": "Issue #3372 is a feature request (type/feature-request), not a bug report. The reporter asks to replace the Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK metapackage dependency (v1.4.230913002) with the narrower Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK.WinUI sub-package (v1.8) in SkiaSharp.Views.WinUI. The factual claim was verified: both the source csproj and the published NuGet package (3.116.1) reference the full metapackage. Since there is no crash, exception, or wrong output to observe, no reproduction is possible \u2014 this is a dependency restructuring request.",
