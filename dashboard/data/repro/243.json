  "notes": "Issue #243 is a feature request (type/feature-request, confidence 0.95) asking for ANGLE GPU rendering libraries to be bundled with SkiaSharp for Windows desktop (WPF/WinForms). There is no defective behavior to reproduce \u2014 the current behavior (no ANGLE DLLs in NuGet, raster-only WinForms/WPF views) is by design. Verified: SkiaSharp 3.116.1 Win32 NativeAssets contains only libSkiaSharp.dll with no ANGLE binaries; WinForms SKControl uses System.Drawing.Bitmap (raster path). The codebase does have ANGLE infrastructure (GRGlInterface.CreateAngle, AngleSwapChainPanel for WinUI) but these are not exposed for WPF/WinForms. Additionally, reproduction of any Windows-specific behavior is not possible on the current macOS environment.",
