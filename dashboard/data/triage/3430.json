When the canvas resizes, the second call (for pixel size mismatch at line 106) destroys the bitmap that was just recreated (at line 91), causing the NRE at line 72.\n\nThe WinUI version avoids this because \u0060pixels\u0060 is obtained from \u0060bitmap.GetPixels()\u0060 \u2014 a single lifecycle. The Uno Skia version uses a separate \u0060GCHandle\u0060-pinned byte array, so the two resources need independent disposal.\n\nPR #3431\u0027s approach of splitting into \u0060FreePixels()\u0060 and \u0060FreeBitmap()\u0060 looks correct and minimal."
