ClickOnce only publishes items with \u0060Build Action = Content\u0060 in its application manifest, but the SkiaSharp NativeAssets package adds the DLLs as \u0060\u003CNone\u003E\u0060 items \u2014 which copies them to build output but not to the ClickOnce deployment.\n\nHere\u0027s the workaround (confirmed working by both reporters):\n\n1. Locate \u0060libSkiaSharp.dll\u0060 in your NuGet cache:\n   \u0060packages\\SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.Win32.{version}\\runtimes\\win-x64\\native\\\u0060 (use \u0060win-x86\u0060 for x86/AnyCPU)\n2. Add it to your project via **Add \u2192 Existing Item**\n3. Set **Build Action = Content** and **Copy to Output Directory = Copy if newer**\n4. Verify it appears in **Publish \u2192 Application Files** with **Action = Include**\n\nAlternatively, MSIX deployment handles native assets correctly without this manual step.\n\nRelated: #1327 (same issue reported in 2020)."
