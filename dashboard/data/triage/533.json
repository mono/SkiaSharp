The root cause is confirmed: \u0060GLTextureView\u0060 (which replaced \u0060GLSurfaceView\u0060 in v1.60.1) does not call \u0060eglSwapInterval\u0060, so the render loop runs uncapped when using \u0060Rendermode.Continuously\u0060.\n\nHere\u0027s a workaround you can use: switch to \u0060Rendermode.WhenDirty\u0060 and drive rendering from a timer at your target frame rate:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060csharp\n// Set the view to only render on demand\nskglView.RenderMode = Rendermode.WhenDirty;\n\n// Timer-based invalidation at ~60 FPS\n// Store timer as a field and dispose on cleanup\nvar timer = new System.Timers.Timer(16.67);\ntimer.Elapsed \u002B= (s, e) =\u003E skglView.RequestRender();\ntimer.Start();\n\n// In cleanup/Dispose:\n// timer.Stop();\n// timer.Dispose();\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n**Note:** On Android, \u0060Android.OS.Handler\u0060 or \u0060View.PostDelayed()\u0060 may be more reliable than \u0060System.Timers.Timer\u0060 for frame timing. Be sure to call \u0060OnPause()\u0060/\u0060OnResume()\u0060 for proper lifecycle management.\n\nFor animation correctness regardless of frame rate, use delta-time (initialize \u0060lastFrame\u0060 to avoid a large first-frame delta):\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060csharp\nvar sw = Stopwatch.StartNew();\nvar lastFrame = sw.Elapsed;\n\nvoid OnPaint(object sender, SKPaintGLSurfaceEventArgs e)\n{\n    var now = sw.Elapsed;\n    var deltaTime = (now - lastFrame).TotalSeconds;\n    lastFrame = now;\n    position \u002B= velocity * (float)deltaTime;\n}\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nA proper engine-level fix would involve either adding \u0060eglSwapInterval(1)\u0060 to the EGL setup, or integrating Android\u0027s Choreographer API for display-synced rendering. Both approaches have tradeoffs around whether VSync should be default or opt-in."
