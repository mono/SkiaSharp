The method returns an IntPtr to the WriteableBitmap\u0027s pixel buffer via WinRT BufferExtensions. The author needs this to build a custom SKXamlCanvas implementation.

The method wraps WinRT BufferExtensions.GetByteBuffer to get a raw IntPtr to the WriteableBitmap\u0027s pixel buffer. This is used internally by SKXamlCanvas for rendering, and Progress wants it public to build their own custom canvas. The change is minimal (1 line) with no behavioral impact, but makes a raw-pointer API part of the public surface.",

Making \u0060GetPixels\u0060 public is reasonable \u2014 it\u0027s the only \u0060WriteableBitmap\u0060 extension in this class that\u0027s still internal, and the use case (custom canvas implementations) is legitimate.\n\nBefore merging, would you be able to add XML documentation to the method?
