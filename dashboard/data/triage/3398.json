If the main render loop is also drawing at the same time, \u0060SKCanvas\u0060, \u0060SKPath\u0060, and \u0060SKPaint\u0060 are being shared across threads \u2014 these types are [not thread-safe](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/skiasharp.skcanvas). The intermittent nature is consistent with a race condition.\n\n2. **GC collection during P/Invoke**: Under GC pressure (rapid PointerMoved calls), the .NET GC can collect managed SkiaSharp objects while their native handles are still in use (#3393). PR #3394 addresses this.\n\nA quick thing to try: **throttle your \u0060GetMapInfo\u0060 calls** in the \u0060PointerMoved\u0060 handler to reduce both GC pressure and the chance of concurrent canvas access:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060csharp\nprivate DateTime _lastMapInfo = DateTime.MinValue;\nprivate void MapControl_PointerMoved(object sender, PointerEventArgs e)\n{\n    if ((DateTime.UtcNow - _lastMapInfo).TotalMilliseconds \u003C 100)\n        return;\n    _lastMapInfo = DateTime.UtcNow;\n    // your GetMapInfo call here\n}\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nAlso \u2014 could you clarify which SkiaSharp version you\u0027re actually using? You selected 3.116.0 in the template, but Comment 2 mentions \u0060SkiaSharp.dll version is 2.88.8.0\u0060. If Mapsui is pinning to 2.88.x, that\u0027s important to know.\n\nThis may also be worth reporting to the Mapsui project, as the rendering path in their \u0060GetMapInfo\u0060 may need synchronization."
