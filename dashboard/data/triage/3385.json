As molesmoke noted, Skia\u0027s \u0060SkColorType\u0060 enum doesn\u0027t include a Gray16 variant \u2014 the only grayscale type is \u0060kGray_8_SkColorType\u0060. The PNG decoder also explicitly strips 16-bit grayscale to 8-bit (\u0060png_set_strip_16\u0060), so even the raw pixel data isn\u0027t preserved during decode.\n\nThis means adding \u0060SKColorType.Gray16\u0060 to SkiaSharp would require upstream Skia changes first.\n\nIn the meantime, if you need the full 16-bit precision, one option is to decode the PNG with a library that supports Gray16 (such as SixLabors.ImageSharp) and import the raw pixel data into an \u0060SKBitmap\u0060 using \u0060SKColorType.Alpha16\u0060 \u2014 it\u0027s semantically \u0022alpha\u0022 rather than \u0022gray,\u0022 but it\u0027s a 16-bit single-channel format that preserves the precision.\n\nIf 8-bit precision is acceptable for your use case, \u0060SKBitmap.Decode()\u0060 will load the image fine \u2014 it just silently downsamples to Gray8."
