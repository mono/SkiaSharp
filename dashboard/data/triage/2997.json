The community comment from molesmoke correctly identifies this as Skia behavior.

The regression claim (2.88.2\u21922.88.3) is unsubstantiated \u2014 no changes to SKMatrix.MapRect or sk_matrix_map_rect appear in the git history.",

The SkiaSharp wrapper delegates directly to Skia with no additional processing. The \u0060sort_as_rect\u0060 function in Skia\u0027s \u0060SkMatrix.cpp\u0060 handles this normalization. As @molesmoke noted, this isn\u0027t a binding issue.\n\nHere\u0027s a workaround that preserves coordinate ordering by transforming the corners individually:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060csharp\nvar topLeft = matrix.MapPoint(inputRect.Left, inputRect.Top);\nvar bottomRight = matrix.MapPoint(inputRect.Right, inputRect.Bottom);\nvar resultRect = new SKRect(topLeft.X, topLeft.Y, bottomRight.X, bottomRight.Y);\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThis gives you the transformed coordinates without the normalization step.
