A dedicated section with curated links would be a nice improvement.\n\nNote that some of the links you suggested (the Xamarin-era tutorials) have been superseded by newer .NET/MAUI resources. An updated version would want to link to the current Microsoft Learn documentation. If you\u0027re still interested in contributing this, a PR would be welcome."
